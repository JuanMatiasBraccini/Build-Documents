	abstract = {The present study presents an electronic decision-support tool that uses a fuzzy-logic model of expert knowledge to assist in multi-criteria decision-making in the context of an Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries (EAF). The prototype model integrates the multiple goals and objectives related to the evaluation of the ecosystem performance of the South African sardine Sardinops sagax fishery into a NetWeaver knowledge base and provides intuitive visual outputs to communicate results to managers and stakeholders. The software tool was developed in a consultative process with key experts and follows the hierarchical tree approach recommended in the FAO guidelines for responsible fisheries. Input variables are based both on quantitative data and expert opinion. We evaluated the model in terms of robustness to input changes, influence of system structure, and appropriateness of input scales for parameters based on expert opinion. Results show that the model is robust and conservative. The strength of the approach lies in the ability to include variables that are difficult to measure. It provides a means of rendering value judgements explicit and transparent. The tool synthesises a large amount of information and aims at improving understanding rather than achieving precision. The system has the potential to have wide application in the context of EAF},

Large assemblages of these species have been observed at seamounts and offshore islands in the eastern tropical Pacific, which are considered hotspots of pelagic biodiversity. Is the species distribution uniform at these hotspots or do species aggregate at a finer spatial scale at these sites? We employed three techniques to demonstrate that the aggregations of scalloped hammerhead sharks, Sphyrna lewini , and other pelagic species were confined to the southeastern corner of Wolf Island in the Galapagos Marine Reserve. Coded ultrasonic transmitters were placed on individuals at this site and at another aggregation site at Darwin Island, separated from Wolf by 40 km, and they were detected by monitors moored at the southeastern corner of Wolf Island and rarely by monitors deployed at other sites around the island. Hammerhead sharks, carrying depth-sensing continual transmitters, were tracked for two-day periods in a vessel and shown to reside a disproportionately large fraction of their time at the southeastern corner. Visual censuses were carried out seasonally at the eight monitor sites at Wolf Island, recording the abundance of one species of tuna, four species of jacks, and a number of other species. The highest diversity and abundance of these species occurred in the southeastern corner of the island. Our results support the use of hammerhead sharks as indicator and umbrella species for pelagic hotspots on a fine scale},

	abstract = {Age and growth parameters of Orectolobus hutchinsi were estimated using micro-radiographs of sectioned vertebrae from 182 wild caught individuals. Two fluorochrome marker dyes, calcein and oxytetracycline, were used to validate the timing and periodicity of vertebral band formation in nine individuals held in the laboratory for between 423 and 472 days. Growth bands were difficult to interpret and final counts were obtained from only 98 (53.8\%) individuals ranging in total length (TL) from 63 to 146 cm. The timing of growth band formation in the vertebrae of captive animals had no predictable temporal pattern, with formation occurring during all seasons of the year, making age validation difficult. Growth band formation was hypothesised to be influenced by non-periodic changes in centrum or somatic growth rather than seasonal growth, as observed in many other elasmobranch species. Growth rates of nine O. hutchinsi held in captivity varied considerably, ranging from 3.5 cm year–1 to 13.8 cm year–1 in total length (mean = 7.03 cm year–1). Although the periodicity of vertebral band formation in captive animals did not support a synchronous annual pattern, captive growth rates matched those predicted when an annual band pattern was assumed for wild caught individuals. Von Bertalanffy growth parameters estimated from vertebral analysis assuming an annual banding pattern and a mean size of birth of 24.1 cm were: L��P = 149.45 cm and K = 0.117 year–1 for both sexes combined. These results illustrate the fundamental importance of validating the periodicity of growth band formation in elasmobranch age and growth studies as it has considerable implications for the management of fisheries that exploit shark and ray species that may exhibit asynchronous growth band deposition},

Fishery-independent, fishery-dependent, and previously published data were used to estimate age specific by-catch mortality and reproductive cycle for incorporation into the analyses. Correspondence analyses were conducted for viability (dead or alive), shark length, month, soaktime, and region. Dead sharks were associated with small size, long soak times, and the spring season, while live sharks were associated with large size and shorter soak times. Data on reproduction suggested a 3-year reproductive cycle consisting of a 2-year gestation period and a 1-year resting period. Litter sizes ranged from 3–12 embryos. Decreasing age-specific fishing mortality and a 3-year reproductive cycle were used in age structured life tables which incorporated stochasticity in life history parameters through Monte Carlo simulation to estimate annual population growth. Demographic analyses showed that the dusky shark population would decline even at low levels of fishing mortality despite low natural mortality for neonates. The demographics of this species make it among the most vulnerable to excessive fishing mortality, and suggest stringent regulatory measures may be required to recover collapsed populations},

	abstract = {Appropriate inference for stocks or species with low-quality data (poor data) or limited data (data poor) is extremely important. Hierarchical Bayesian methods are especially applicable to small-area, small-sample-size estimation problems because they allow poor-data species to borrow strength from species with good-quality data. We used a hammerhead shark complex as an example to investigate the advantages of using hierarchical Bayesian models in assessing the status of poor-data and data-poor exploited species. The hammerhead shark complex (Sphyrna spp.) along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts of the United States is composed of three species: the scalloped hammerhead (S. lewini), the great hammerhead (S. mokarran), and the smooth hammerhead (S. zygaena) sharks. The scalloped hammerhead comprises 70-80\% of the catch and has catch and relative abundance data of good quality, whereas great and smooth hammerheads have relative abundance indices that are both limited and of low quality presumably because of low stock density and limited sampling. Four hierarchical Bayesian state-space surplus production models were developed to simulate variability in population growth rates, carrying capacity, and catchability of the species. The results from the hierarchical Bayesian models were considerably more robust than those of the nonhierarchical models. The hierarchical Bayesian approach represents an intermediate strategy between traditional models that assume different population parameters for each species and those that assume all species share identical parameters. Use of the hierarchical Bayesian approach is suggested for future hammerhead shark stock assessments and for modeling fish complexes with species-specific data, because the poor-data species can borrow strength from the species with good data, making the estimation more stable and robust.},

	volume = {49},
	url = {http://www.publish.csiro.au/paper/MF98017},
	abstract = {Sharks and other chondrichthyans are often described as long lived, slow growing and producing few offspring. These biological characteristics, together with the common assumption that recruitment is directly related to stock, and pessimistic stock prognoses obtained from application of demographic analysis, have led to doubts that sharks can be harvested sustainably. Developed over the past 40 or so years from studies of only a few shark species, these doubts have been reinforced by declining catch rates in industrial, artisanal and recreational fisheries and in fishing programmes designed to reduce the risk of sharks attacking humans at bathing beaches. However, more recent studies and application of modelling techniques allowing for density-dependent responses to the effects of stock reduction indicate that shark stocks can be harvested sustainably and, if carefully managed, can provide very stable fisheries. It is now understood that some species (such as Galeorhinus galeus, Carcharhinus plumbeus, Carcharodon carcharias and several species of dogfish) have low productivity, whereas other species (such as Mustelus antarcticus, Rhizoprionodon terraenovae, Sphyrna tiburo and Prionace glauca) have higher productivity. This paper reviews the use of shark products, the effects of fishing on shark populations of the world, and recent developments in assessment of shark fishery stocks.},

	abstract = {Large-scale shark-control programs at popular beaches in New South Wales and Queensland, Australia, and KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa, provide protection against shark attack. Although these programs have enhanced bathing safety, reducing the environmental impacts of decades of fishing for large sharks and the associated by-catch remains a challenge. Over the past three decades, there have been several interventions to reduce such impact in the KZN program. The first was the release of all live sharks, including those species known to be responsible for fatal shark attacks. Measures to reduce catches of sharks associated with the winter influx of shoals of sardines, Sardinops sagax, have been increasingly successful. In addition, extensive removal of nets has resulted in a major reduction in effort. Collectively, these initiatives reduced mortalities of sharks by 64\%. Baited lines, termed drumlines, were introduced at 18 beaches, where they replaced some of the nets. The former had a far lower by-catch of rays, turtles and cetaceans and significantly lower catches of certain shark species. Replacement of some nets with drumlines is planned for the remaining beaches. Only two attacks, both non-fatal, have occurred at protected beaches in KZN over the past three decades, indicating that the program has maintained its public safety mandate while it has succeeded in reducing its impact on the environment},

	abstract = {Age-length data were derived from counting stained bands on whole vertebral centra obtained from gummy shark, Mustelus antarcticus, captured by gill-nets during 1973-76 in Bass Strait and from gummy shark and school shark, Galeorhinus galeus, captured during 1986-87 in Bass Strait and waters off South Australia. The data were fitted to the von Bertalanffy growth equation after adopting the Francis reparametrization and correcting for sampling bias caused by the selectivity effects of the gill-nets of various mesh sizes used to capture the sharks. The von Bertalanffy growth curves of male and female gummy shark were significantly different, but the growth curves of male and female school shark were not. The growth curves suggest that growth rates of male and female gummy shark in Bass Strait were lower during 1986-87 than during 1973-76 and that the growth rates of male and female gummy shark and school shark in Bass Strait during 1986-87 were lower than those in South Australia at the same time. These apparent temporal and spatial differences in growth patterns of gummy shark are explained by the 'Phenomenon of Apparent Change in Growth Rate'. It is concluded that the growth curves determined for 1986-87 are distorted by the effects of a long history of high and length-selective fishing mortality and that actual growth patterns of gummy shark are better represented by the von Bertalanffy growth equation determined for shark caught in Bass Strait during 1973-76, when fishing mortality was much lower. Verification of age estimates was attempted by comparing von Bertalanffy growth curves derived from age-length data with those derived from tag release-recapture length-increment data, but these comparisons highlight the limitations of using tag data for this purpose. Although reasonable agreement was found between such growth curves for gummy shark, it appears that school shark older than 11 years cannot be aged accurately from stained whole or sectioned vertebrae. Sectioned vertebrae from a school shark recaptured 35.7 years after being tagged and released and calculated as having an age exceeding 45 years gave estimates of only 18-20 years of age.},

	abstract = {The link between landscape properties and foraging decisions by herbivores remains unclear, but such knowledge is central to the understanding of plant–herbivore dynamics. Our goal was to determine whether fine-scale foraging paths of free-ranging elk ( Cervus canadensis ) respond to spatial structure of habitats in Yellowstone National Park. During winter 2002 we gathered elk-foraging information by following snow tracks in open habitats located on hillsides and flat terrain. The 21 snow paths surveyed were comprised on average of 15 discrete snow craters connected to each other by relatively straight-line movements. Our analyses revealed two levels of selection: elk chose where to dig, and how much search effort to allocate at digging sites based on habitat characteristics. On hillsides, elk preferentially dug in areas of greater biomass of grasses and forbs, and simply walked through poorer sites without digging. Individuals also searched more intensively, creating larger craters, where food biomass was higher. On flat terrain, crater size decreased with snow depth and increased with snow density. Correlated random walk models usually were adequate to characterize elk movement on flat terrain, but not on hillsides. First, as the number of movements between local foraging areas increased, elk displacements on hillsides became shorter than expected from random patterns. This trend on hillsides was strongly influenced by interindividual variation in movement behavior. Second, elk tended to forage perpendicularly to aspect, resulting in horizontal displacements. Our study demonstrates that free-ranging elk adjust their foraging to fine-scale habitat structure},

	abstract = {The intracoelomic surgical implantation of telemetry transmitters in fish is becoming the standard tagging approach for most field telemetry studies. Subsequently, efforts must be made to ensure the welfare of the fish are maintained and that fish do not experience significant mortality or sublethal impairments in health, behavior or physiology as a result of surgical procedures. Therefore, it is essential to adequately report information relating to all aspects of the surgical procedure to enable the reader to make an accurate interpretation of study results. We conducted a quantitative literature review aimed at characterizing trends in data reporting by examining a sample of fish telemetry studies published in peer-reviewed outlets during the last 20-�years. We used a repeatability score, based on 16 predetermined criteria, to evaluate the reporting of surgical procedures in telemetry studies. The majority of studies failed to report basic information relating to the surgical procedures used. Repeatability scores were highly variable between studies and ranged from 0–93.8\%. No single study provided complete information (mean repeatability score-�=-�50.7\%) and repeatability showed no trend over time. Some study information was consistently well reported (e.g. tag size and dimensions, the type of anaesthetic used and the location of incision). In contrast, the type of suture knots, duration or level of anaesthesia and precautions taken to minimize infection were consistently left out of the methods section of most telemetry studies. Our review was confounded by the large proportion of studies that cited other sources for their surgical methods, many of which themselves lacked complete information. We recommend that future electronic tagging studies that involve intracoelomic implantation include the minimum reporting standards presented in this paper. Increasing the detail of reporting will improve the quality of data presented, minimize welfare and ethical concerns and allow transparency for study repeatability},

As body size increased, importance of elasmobranchs in the diet of C. obscurus increased, while most other groups remained at similar levels. Furgaleus macki had a specialized diet, feeding almost exclusively on octopus and other cephalopods. The diet of M. antarcticus was dominated by benthic and epibenthic prey, including crabs, lobsters, tetraodontid fishes and octopus. As M. antarcticus increased in size there was an increase in the occurrence of rock lobster and a decrease in the occurrence of crabs in the diet. Differences in the diet were also noted between male and female M. antarcticus, but were confounded with differences between size classes.},

A state-space Kalman filter statistical model was used to estimate geolocation errors, movement parameters, and most probable tracks from the recovered data. Standard deviation estimates ranged from 0.5-� to 4.4-� latitude and from 0.2-� to 1.6-� longitude. Bias estimates ranged from −1.9-� to 4.1-� latitude and from −0.5-� to 3.0-� longitude. Estimates of directed movement were close to zero for most fish reaching a maximum magnitude of 5.3-�nm-�day−1 for the one fish that moved away from its release site. Diffusivity estimates were also low, ranging from near zero to 1000-�nm2-�day−1. Low values of the estimated movement parameters are consistent with the restricted scale of the observed movement and the apparent fidelity of bigeye to geographical points of attraction. Inclusion of a time-dependent model of the variance in geolocation estimates reduced the variability of latitude estimates. The state-space Kalman filter model appears to provide realistic estimates of in situ geolocation errors and movement parameters, provides a means to avoid indeterminate latitude estimates during equinoxes, and is a potential bridge between analyses of individual and population movements},

Smooth-hound shark fed mainly on crustaceans, fishes and cephalopods. Sipunculids, polychaetes and echinoderms were occasional preys. No differences were found between the diets of males and females. Ontogenetic changes in diet of M.-�mustelus were apparent, with crustaceans forming a greater proportion of the diet of smaller sharks. Both teleosts and molluscs increased in importance with increasing shark size. Consumptions of polycheates, sipunculids and echinoderms were not related to predator size. Prey diversity also increased with size, with large and mobile prey species found more commonly in the diet of larger sharks. The limited overlap in the dietary compositions of juveniles, subadults and adults suggests the possibility of resource partitioning.

We review the oceanographic setting of the region and present evidence that such aggregations form as a result of migratory behavior associated with climatic and oceanographic processes. We utilise records of whale shark abundance collected at Ningaloo Reef from dedicated searches by boat and aircraft and from log sheets recorded by the tourism industry. Measures of whale shark abundance derived from log sheet data sets were moderately correlated with the Southern Oscillation Index and weakly correlated with coastal sea level, an index of the strength of the Leeuwin Current, and sea surface temperature over the period 1993 to 1998. Abundances of whale sharks derived from boat searches from 1983 to 1992 were also correlated with fluctuations in the Southern Oscillation Index, except during a three year period from 1988 to 1990. We conclude that, at least in some years, there appears to be a link between the abundance of aggregating whale sharks and the physical and biological oceanography of the region, with greater whale shark numbers in La Ni+�a years. The lack of correlation in other years may be due to a combination of uneven quality of data and/or aggregations occurring in response to a complex interaction between the physical and biological oceanography of the region},

One possible reason for this low return rate could be post-release mortality caused by capture stress from the experimental longline. Plasma catecholamine levels were analysed to evaluate stress levels in longline-captured, rod-and-reel-captured and unstressed docile sharks. The mean catecholamine values determined for the three tag–release species ranged from 6539 to 22-�079 pg mL–1. The level of adrenaline found in moribund I. oxyrinchus (94-�807 pg mL–1) was much higher than in either P. glauca (46-�845 pg mL–1) or A. vulpinus (36-�890 pg mL–1). In contrast, blood obtained from sharks that were landed within minutes had lower catecholamine values (P. glauca, 889 and 1347 pg mL–1; I. oxyrinchus, 2960 and 3946 pg mL–1, adrenaline and noradrenaline respectively). Among the nine I. oxyrinchus specimens that were recaptured long after their longline capture and release, the highest adrenaline level measured just before release was 33-�352 pg mL–1.

Here, we develop such a model for the flightless tansy leaf beetle Chrysolina graminis moving within and between patches of its host plant tansy Tanacetum vulgare . To parameterize the model, beetle movement paths on timescales of minutes were observed in uniform plots of tansy and inter-patch matrix (meadow) vegetation. Movement lasted longer, covered greater distances and had narrower turning angles in the matrix. Simulations of the model emulated an independent two-season multi-patch mark–resight study at daily timescales and included variable boundary-mediated behaviour affecting the probability of leaving habitat patches. As boundaries in the model became stronger there were disproportionately large decreases in net displacements, inter-patch movements and the proportion of beetles in the matrix. The model produced realistic patterns of population-level displacement over periods up to 13 days with fully permeable boundaries for one dataset and strong boundaries for the other. This may be explained by the heights of the tansy patches in each study, as beetles will be unable to cross the boundary near the top of a patch that emerges from the matrix. The simulations demonstrate the important effects of boundary behaviour on displacement patterns and indicate temporal and spatial variability in permeability. Realistic models of movement must therefore include behaviour at habitat boundaries},

The most reliable features for repeat identification in multiple years were the pigment patterns on the gill flaps, pelvic fins, and caudal fins. Pigment patterns in all three regions were asymmetrical on the right and left sides making it necessary to photograph both sides to catalog each individual. However, once cataloged, an individual could be re-identified using a partial body image. Using this method, 73 individuals were identified between 2001 and 2005. Site fidelity was indicated through repeated annual sightings of individuals with 78\% of the identified sharks observed over at least 2-�years. Males were found to arrive at Guadalupe Island as early as July and females in September. Peak abundances at the site occurred August–December.

	abstract = {The life histories of two globally endangered hammerhead sharks, Sphyrna lewini and Sphyrna mokarran, were examined using samples collected from a range of commercial fisheries operating along the east coast of Australia. The catch of S. lewini was heavily biased towards males, and there were significant differences in von Bertalanffy growth parameters (L��P and k) and maturity [stretched total length (LST) and age (A) at which 50\% are mature, LST50 and A50] between those caught in the tropics (L��P = 2119 mm, k = 0-+163, LST50 = 1471 mm, A50 = 5-+7 years) and those caught in temperate waters (L��P = 3199 mm, k = 0-+093, LST50 = 2043 mm, A50 = 8-+9 years). The best-fit estimates for a three-parameter von Bertalanffy growth curve fit to both sexes were L��P = 3312 mm, L0 = 584 mm and k = 0-+076. Males attained a maximum age of 21 years and grew to at least 2898 mm LST. The longevity, maximum length and maturity of females could not be estimated as mature animals could not be sourced from any fishery. Length at birth inferred from neonates with open umbilical scars was 465–563 mm LST. There was no significant difference in length and age at maturity of male and female S. mokarran, which reached 50\% maturity at 2279 mm LST and 8-+3 years. Sphyrna mokarran grew at a similar rate to S. lewini and the best-fit estimates for a two-parameter von Bertalanffy equation fit to length-at-age data for sexes combined with an assumed mean length-at-birth of 700 mm were L��P = 4027 mm and k = 0-+079. Females attained a maximum age of 39-+1 years and grew to at least 4391 mm LST. The oldest male S. mokarran was 31-+7 years old and 3691 mm LST. Validation of annual growth-band deposition in S. mokarran was achieved through a mark, tag and recapture study},

	abstract = {Large pelagic predators move quickly in and out of local ecosystems that may be separated by long distances: their trophic effects are determined by their behaviour while present. To investigate movement and local residence times of one such predator we implanted 29 acoustic tags into juvenile southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii) (SBT) in the Great Australian Bight. We used acoustic detectors at a reef known to attract tuna and detected fifteen SBT on 941 occasions over 62 days. SBT were tagged at the reef, 40 km, and 120 km distant. A total of 100\% of local and 60\% of SBT tagged 40 km away were subsequently recorded at the reef. Presence and absence was related to an upwelling event. Water temperature decreased just after SBT departure from the monitoring region. The immediate area was aerially surveyed 22 times for SBT schools during the experiment. We combined aerial survey observations with computer simulation, calibrated against field studies of SBT movement, to test the hypothesis that tuna could be well simulated by a correlated random walk throughout the area of known occurrence. The most plausible explanation for the observed behaviour was short-term (hours) fidelity to schools combined with medium-term (weeks) fidelity to bathymetric features. The present study illustrates how dynamic models aid interpretation of experiments designed to understand trophic effects of large pelagic predators},

	abstract = {Advances in electronic tagging and genetic research are making it possible to discern population structure for pelagic marine predators once thought to be panmictic. However, reconciling migration patterns and gene flow to define the resolution of discrete population management units remains a major challenge, and a vital conservation priority for threatened species such as oceanic sharks. Many such species have been flagged for international protection, yet effective population assessments and management actions are hindered by lack of knowledge about the geographical extent and size of distinct populations. Combining satellite tagging, passive acoustic monitoring and genetics, we reveal how eastern Pacific white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) adhere to a highly predictable migratory cycle. Individuals persistently return to the same network of coastal hotspots following distant oceanic migrations and comprise a population genetically distinct from previously identified phylogenetic clades. We hypothesize that this strong homing behaviour has maintained the separation of a northeastern Pacific population following a historical introduction from Australia/New Zealand migrants during the Late Pleistocene. Concordance between contemporary movement and genetic divergence based on mitochondrial DNA demonstrates a demographically independent management unit not previously recognized. This population's fidelity to discrete and predictable locations offers clear population assessment, monitoring and management options},

Movement patterns of Acanthopagrus australis, Pomadasys kaakan, Lutjanus russelli and Mugil cephalus were examined between December 2006 and April 2007 using a stationary passive integrated transponder (PIT) system adapted for saline environments (30-38�ppt) and underwater digital video cameras (DVCs). This is the second known application of a stationary PIT tag system to studying fish movement in estuarine environments. The transponder system was set in place for 104�days and recorded {\textgreater}5000 detections. Overall [`]recapture' rate of tagged fish by the transponder system was {\textgreater}40\%. We used PIT tags implanted in a total of 75 fish from a tidal creek connected to the main channel of the estuary. We also developed a high-resolution digital elevation (2.5�m cell size) model of the estuary derived from airborne light detection and ranging (LIDAR) and aerial imagery to estimate inundation dynamics within the tidal creek, and related the timing of inundation in various habitats to the timing of fish immigration to and emigration from the creek. Over 50\% of all tagged fish were moving in and out of the creek at a threshold level when 50\% of the mangrove forest became flooded. Individuals of all four species moved into and out of the tidal creek repeatedly at different times depending on species and size, indicating strong residential behaviour within the estuary. The main activity of fishes was at night time. Manual interpretation of video from {\textgreater}700 fish sightings at three different mangrove sites confirmed the findings of the stationary PIT system, that the function of shelter vs food in mangrove habitat may be size dependent. Our established techniques assess the spatial ecology of estuarine fish and provide important insights into fish habitat utilisation and site fidelity behaviour},

	abstract = {Conservation of ecologically related species and understanding the discard composition of fisheries are major concerns for marine ecosystem conservation. However, high sea longline fisheries data are insufficient because of difficulties in deploying observers for data collection. Observer data collected from 77 trips on Taiwanese large-scale longline fishing vessels in the Indian Ocean from June 2004 to March 2008 were used to estimate the scale of the bycatch. At least 40 species were recorded. Albacore, bigeye, yellowfin, and southern bluefin tuna were the major species recorded and comprised over 73.30\% of the total retained catch. Major bycatch species were swordfish, blue shark, sailfish, pomfret, and escolar. The average discard rate was 14.09\%, ranging from 3.20\% for the yellowfin tuna fleet to 18.09\% for the bigeye tuna fleet. In total, 0.80\% of the catch of the albacore, 4.74\% of the bigeye, and 2.32\% of the yellowfin tuna were discarded. There were significant differences among seasons and areas for the discard rates of the bigeye and yellowfin tuna. The discard rates of the bigeye and southern bluefin tuna were positively correlated to the catch per unit effort. The depredation percentage of tuna by cetaceans was from 0.7\% to 12.3\% of total discards for the different fleets. The high discard and cetacean depredation rates showed that major possible reasons for discards are depredation by cetaceans, economic factors, and quota limitations. Regarding other species, 61 seabirds and 84 sea turtles were a part of the bycatch. The major species were Indian Yellow-nosed Albatross in the southern Indian Ocean and Olive Ridley turtles in tropical areas. The estimated annual incidental catch numbers were 715 to 311 seabirds and 1856 to 1127 sea turtles from 2004 to 2007. For conservation, this discard information could be used to assess tuna stocks. Mitigation measures, including the live release of small-sized fish, and the use of bird-scaring lines and circle hooks, are required to minimize the bycatch},

These surveys were designed primarily to monitor the relative abundance of sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria). To prepare for the future termination of these joint surveys, between 1988 and 1994 NMFS performed similar long-line surveys aboard US vessels in the Gulf of Alaska. These paired (i.e. duplicated) surveys from 1988 to 1994, provide a basis for comparing future NMFS survey results with the past time series of joint US and Japanese surveys (i.e. the joint 1979–1994 surveys). This paper describes how modeling the log-ratio of paired cpue results (i.e. the log[(NMFS cpue)/(joint cpue)]), from a standardized survey design, was used to provide a basis for converting the joint survey cpue values to values directly comparable to those from the NMFS surveys.

An approach is outlined for conducting stock assessments in which parameters are estimated for multiple stocks at the same time. Information from data-rich stock assessments, e.g. trends in fishing mortality, and values for parameters of selectivity functions are provided to data-poor assessments in the form of penalties on the estimated parameters, which leads to stock assessments for the most data-poor stocks being informed by those for the most data-rich stocks. The method is applied for example purposes to data for nine stocks in Australia's southern and eastern scalefish and shark fishery. The results of the application confirm that results for data-rich stocks are little impacted by being assessed in conjunction with data-poor stocks and that the results for data-poor stocks can be qualitatively different when information for data-rich stocks is taken into account},

	abstract = {The river sharks (genus Glyphis) are a small group of poorly known sharks occurring in tropical rivers and estuarine waters across northern Australia, south-east Asia and the subcontinent. The taxonomy of the genus has long been unclear due to very few individuals having been caught and examined, resulting in a paucity of data regarding their distribution, biology and ecology. Only recently has attention focussed on the two Australian species, G. glyphis and G. garricki. This study is a result of a rare opportunity to collate the few samples that have been collected from these species and the bull shark Carcharhinus leucas, which shares an overlapping range. These samples were analysed using the DNA barcoding approach (cox1 mitochondrial gene), compared with six other species of carcharhinids and evaluated in light of the current taxonomic classification. Nine species-specific nucleotide differences were found between G. glyphis and G. garricki and no intra-specific variation provides strong support for the separation into distinct species. Significant differences were also observed at the inter-generic level, with Glyphis forming a distinct clade from Carcharhinus. This study provides the basis for future molecular studies required to better address conservation issues confronting G. glyphis and G. garricki in Australia},

	abstract = {The movement of bonnetheads, Sphyrna tiburo, within an estuarine system on the Gulf of Mexico coast of Florida was examined to define response to salinity change. Shark presence and movements were evaluated by acoustic monitoring and gillnet sampling. Acoustic monitoring data were used to investigate active selection of different zones within the estuary based on differences in salinity among zones. Sharks were monitored for 187-�days in 2003 and 217-�days in 2004 in salinities ranging from 11.0 to 31.0-�ppt in 2003 and 15.8 to 34.6-�ppt in 2004. Monitoring data supported the hypothesis that salinity played a role in the distribution and movement of S. tiburo. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) data obtained from gillnet sampling from 1995 to 2004 were examined to determine affinity or avoidance of specific salinities within the study site as calculated using an electivity index. Electivity analysis showed almost no affinity or avoidance for specific salinity values. The difference in results between the CPUE and acoustic monitoring in relation to the potential effects of salinity likely relate to the nature of the data, with acoustic monitoring providing continuous data and CPUE providing snapshot location data. The results of this study suggest that although S. tiburo are collected within a wide range of salinity levels, salinity may affect movement and distribution. Salinity effects may be more pronounced during periods of prolonged and/or large changes in salinity as detected by long-term monitoring},

The risk to this population, however, would increase if the shark gillnet fishery operating in the region were to retain the species as a by-product. Demographic analysis indicated that the species has medium intrinsic population growth rate and potential rebound in comparison with other chondrichthyan species, juveniles have higher elasticity than mature females and both juvenile and mature females have higher elasticities than hatchlings. Because of its low biological productivity and moderate resilience to the effects of fishing, cautious management measures will be necessary to ensure the sustainable use of H. portusjacksoni if its marketing increases in the future. Information on the dynamics of a population that is valuable to provide management advice can be obtained through demographic methods, but rapid assessment methods can also provide complementary information on the effects of fishing by considering the catch susceptibility of the population to each fishing method},

	abstract = {This paper illustrates some practical Geographical Information System (GIS) applications for aiding fishery managers and coastal area planners in analysing the likely interactions of ports, inshore fleets, and local non-migratory inshore stocks, and in providing a flexible modelling framework for decision making on fishery development and zoning issues. The classic geographical “friction of distance” approach to generating fields of action around home ports of inshore fleets which largely make day trips to their adjacent fishing grounds, is compared with a more flexible empirical “Gaussian Effort Allocation” (GEAM) modelling approach where peak effort may occur at different distances from port. The latter approach is considered more appropriate in describing resource depletion with distance. The geographical implications of fishing effort and intensity fields are contrasted, and compared with Beverton and Holt’s (1957)ideas on the effect of distance from port on the “limiting effort distribution”. Similar readily-calculated geographical reference points for inshore fishing fleets are derived. The GEAM framework allows a range of geographical characteristics to be taken into account in describing the interactions of ports and local fleets with inshore resources and local fishing grounds, and unlike friction of distance concepts, allows for resource depletion close to port. Two examples are given of fitting effort “fields” from port-based fleets to observed data, in this case on survey biomass, following the assumption of local effort allocation proportional to local catch rate. Procedures are also suggested for collecting prior information on fleet activity to tune the model. The GEAM model is also suggested as an aid to deciding on the location of marine parks or fishery closure areas},

However, very little is known about most aspects of this species for the south-eastern Pacific. In the present paper, the age and growth parameters of the shortfin mako, caught by Chilean swordfish longline fisheries from 2004 to 2005, are reported. Ages were estimated by counting band-pairs from sections of vertebral centra from 547 individuals, ranging from 76 to 330 cm in total length (TL). Trends in the proportion of opaque edges for all ages combined and grouped into ages 0–6 and 7–26 years indicated that they are formed during summer and showed that annually, one band-pair is formed in the vertebrae of shortfin makos. Modal-progression analysis was used to verify the first three age classes (ages 0–2 years). For both sexes, the oldest estimated age was 25+ years. Von Bertalanffy growth parameters were estimated at L��P = 325.29 cm TL, K = 0.076 year–1 and t0 = –3.18 years for females and L��P = 296.60 cm TL, K = 0.087 year–1 and t0 = –3.58 years for males. The results indicated that this species is highly vulnerable to exploitation and, thus, urgent conservation measures are required},

Despite recent global concern and intensive ecological studies on this species, little is known about its reproduction, owing to a paucity of information on mature females. We investigated the size-at-maturity and reproductive traits of shortfin mako in the western and central North Pacific. Males attain maturity at a much smaller size (156-�cm) than females (256-�cm). The positive relationship between maternal size and litter size indicates that fecundity increases as the female grows. The seasonal trends in the gonadosomatic index of mature individuals and the presence of females in early pregnancy confirmed that mating occurs from spring to summer. From monthly changes in embryonic body lengths, averaged per litter, and the seasonal occurrence of neonates, we infer that parturition occurs from winter to spring and the gestation period is 9–13 months. There was a negative correlation between embryonic developmental stages and environmental temperature for females in various stages of pregnancy. The productivity of this species may be higher than previously thought, considering the estimated gestation period and size-related fecundity},

Antibiotic use during electronic tag implantation must conform to relevant drug laws and regulations in the country where work is being done, including the requirements for withdrawal times before human consumption is a possibility. Currently, the choice of antibiotics (most often tetracycline or oxytetracycline) and the use of a single dose of the drug are decisions made without knowledge of the basic need for antibiotic usage and of the bacteria involved in infections that occur following electronic tag implantation. Correct perioperative use of an antibiotic is to apply the drug to the animal before surgery begins, to assure serum and tissue levels of the drug are adequate before the incision is made. However, the most common perioperative application of antibiotics during implantation of an electronic tag is to delay the administration of the drug, injecting it into the coelom after the electronic tag is inserted, just prior to closure of the incision. There is little empirical evidence that the present application of antibiotics in fish being implanted with electronic tags is of value. Improvements should first be made to surgical techniques, especially the use of aseptic techniques and sterilized instruments and electronic tags, before resorting to antibiotics},

Vertebral sections from 131 males (43.5-124�cm TL) and 146 females (46-146�cm TL) were analyzed. The index of average percentage of error (IAPE) estimated from two readings ranged from 1.61 to 4.83 (mean: 6.66\%) in the vertebrae of specimens between 0 and 15 years of age. The monthly marginal increment (MIR) ratio revealed a tendency toward band pair deposition between autumn and winter, whereas the monthly distribution of growth band pair classes revealed that the first band pair appears on the vertebrae of newborns (ages 0+) about 6 months after birth (by June). This deposition pattern was found in specimens with one, two and three band pairs on the vertebrae (1+ and 2+, respectively), thereby confirming annual band pair completion in winter. Growth parameters were derived using the von Bertalanffy model (VBGM), VBGMb (modified by length at birth: L0), the Richards, Gompertz and Schnute models. No significant differences in growth rates were detected between the two sampling periods (1994-1999 and 2004-2008). Models with multiple inflection points, particularly the Richards model, best represented growth for the species, which was evidenced by the lowest Akaike information criterion value. There were no differences in growth between sexes. Growth parameters estimated for both sexes were L[infinity]�=�129.34�cm (SE�=�1.35), k�=�0.24 (SE�=�0.009) and m�=�1.34 with the Richards model. The "average" model was determined by averaging L[infinity] between the models with substantial statistical support that were considered the most plausible (Richards and Gompertz). Thus, a consensual L[infinity]�=�130.69�cm, estimated by multi-model inference, was employed to minimize the effects of sample size and selectivity. Males and females mature at 6 years of age and the largest specimen in the catches was 15 years of age (132�cm TL). Local fishing exploitation using gillnets caught only juveniles, whereas the longlines used for the surveys caught subadult and adult specimens. C. acronotus is a relatively fast-growing species inhabiting shallow coastal waters throughout its lifespan, which is a pattern to be taken into account in the years to come for the management of coastal exploitation targeting valuable teleosts},

	abstract = {This paper derives relationships between fishing power, fishing effort, density, fishing intensity and fishing mortality. Fishing power is defined as the product of the area of influence of the gear during a unit operation and the efficiency of the gear during that operation. As a consequence of its definition it is shown that fishing power is the effective area covered by the gear during a unit operation. Fishing effort is defined as the product of fishing power and the number of unit operations and is therefore the total effective area covered by the gear during a number of unit operations. Consequently catch per unit effort is a direct measure of the density of the fish. Fishing intensity is defined as the fishing effort per unit area per unit time and hence is equal to the effective area covered by the gear per unit time as a fraction of the area occupied by the stock. It also shows that fishing intensity is the fraction of the fish which are caught per unit time provided certain requirements underlying the theory are well met.Fishing mortality is defined as the fraction of the fish caught per unit time from which it follows that when the requirements referred to above are satisfied fishing mortality is also equal to fishing intensity. Fishing power is difficult to measure and therefore the concept of relative fishing power as a measurable quantity is introduced. This leads to a discussion of relative fishing effort, relative density and relative fishing intensity. Relative fishing intensity is proportional to fishing mortality and as such can be used to record changes in fishing mortality. Furthermore, if the constant of proportionality, the catchability coefficient, is measured, the relative fishing intensity can be used for direct estimation of fishing mortality},

The primary objective of this project was to investigate the depths and temperatures of the waters occupied by large juvenile sandbar sharks of the northwest Atlantic population during the winter months and the overwintering localities of these animals using a fishery independent method. During the summer of 2003, 21 sandbar sharks captured in the Eastern Shore of Virginia bays and lagoons were outfitted with satellite transmitters that were programmed to detach during the following winter. The sharks occurred in significantly colder and deeper waters during the winter period than during the summer nursery period with a mean depth and temperature recorded by the transmitters during the winter period of 19.9-�C and 20.8-�m and a mean depth and temperature recorded during the summer period of 24.0-�C and 4.3-�m. Despite this decrease in temperature and increase in depth of occurrence, the sharks remained in relatively warm waters and shallow depths throughout the overwintering period. Satellite pop-off locations during the overwintering period were concentrated in central North Carolina coastal waters, where a unique combination of shallow depths and warm temperatures may contribute to the survivorship of these animals while they overwinter in these waters},

Age-structured demographic models were developed using empirical estimates of fecundity, longevity and maturity to project population growth parameters and potential responses to fishing mortality of Dasyatis dipterura from the Bah+�a Magdalena lagoon complex, M+�xico. Monte Carlo simulation was incorporated to include uncertainty in life history parameters into model projections. Six models were developed using deterministic and probabilistic approaches under unexploited and exploited (fishing mortality = 0.05 year–1) conditions. Mean annual population growth rates (++) of 1.05–1.06 (5–6\% increase), net reproductive rates of 2.3–2.4 and generation times of 14.9–16.5 years were projected from simulations. The introduction of a low fishing mortality into probabilistic models produced ++ of 1.01 year–1. Elasticity analysis indicated that population growth rates for D. dipterura are more strongly influenced by the survival of juvenile and adult stages than by survival of neonates or changes in fecundity. Demographic analyses indicated that D. dipterura has a low intrinsic growth potential and limited resilience to fishing pressure. Localised depletion or population collapses are therefore likely to occur through unrestricted, unmonitored fishing effort},

In all, 579 tags (5.5\%) were recovered. Tag shedding was estimated to be low (0.025 year –1 for C. tilstoni) and tagging mortality was significantly lower for sharks caught by hand-line than by gill-net. Australian gill-netters, Taiwanese gill-netters (fishing in the Australian Fishing Zone) and Australian prawn trawlers accounted for most of the returns. The maximum distance between the release and recapture positions was {\textgreater}1100 km, but most returns were made within 50 km of the tagging site. Nearly all the releases were in inshore waters fished by Australian vessels. Although many recaptures were made by the offshore Taiwanese fishery, the Taiwanese fishing effort was much higher than for the inshore Australian fishery, so that relative to fishing effort, relatively few sharks moved from inshore to offshore waters.},

	abstract = {Using nominal fishing effort to control fishing mortality and using cpue data from commercial fisheries as abundance indices require ability to correct fishing power for temporal development. It is often assumed in ICES stock assessments that fishing power is constant over time. However, experience has suggested that this assumption may be false. This study investigates the time dynamics of an Index of Fishing Power (IFP). This index is based on the fleet's cpue, relative to the cpue of a subset of vessels from the same fleet. The primary characteristic of the reference vessels is that their fishing power has not varied much over time. IFP is calculated for some of the Danish cod fisheries in the Baltic Sea. IFP appeared to be independent of the vessel composition of the reference sub-fleet and for the fleets fishing in the Eastern Baltic Sea, but less so for the Western Baltic Sea fleets. Variations in IFP are analysed by a GLM (General Linear Model). Results suggest that fishing power has developed in the Eastern Baltic Sea cod fishery at an annual rate of 2\% and 6\% for trawlers and gillnetters respectively. Mechanisms of fishing power creeping may include increased technical efficiency and also changes in vessel composition of the fleets over the period of analysis},

Gravid females were most abundant from April to June, whereas post-partum females composed most of the catch in August to September. Adult males were present all year although were more abundant between February and July. No neonates were captured during the study and most embryos collected measured slightly below the reported total length (LT) at time of birth (L0) for the species, suggesting that parturition may occur slightly outside the main fishing grounds or that neonates were not captured in commercial gillnets set at this time of the year. The mean LT at maturity (LT50) for males was 578 mm and females matured between 620 and 660 mm, although a precise estimate of LT50 for females could not be determined. The total length (LT) and total mass (MT) relationship was calculated for both sexes and showed no significant differences. The mean condition factor increased steadily from February to July followed by a steep decrease in values relative to females in August and September, suggesting a pupping season.

The total sex ratio \textit{post partum} was significantly biased towards females (1:1.57), but significantly more immature males than immature females were sampled (1.45:1), indicating sexual segregation. Females and males were categorized into reproductive stages according to changes in their reproductive tract. Size at sexual maturity for females was estimated to be \&\#732;65 cm total length (TL), and males matured at between \&\#732;65 and 70 cm TL. Gravid females had 1 to 8 embryos that approached a size at parturition of between \&\#732;33 and 37 cm TL. The sex ratio of embryos was significantly biased towards females (1:1.79). Positive linear relationships were detected between TL of mature females and ovarian and uterine fecundities. Concurrent ovulation and gestation cycles and a clear relationship between embryonic development and maturation of the ovary showed that females are ready to copulate immediately after parturition.

Misspent youth: does catching immature fish affect fisheries sustainability? – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 68: 1525–1534. The “spawn-at-least-once” principle suggests that sustainability is secured if fish become vulnerable to commercial gears only after they have spawned. However, some studies suggest that protecting immature fish is not essential to sustainability because extrinsic factors determine both recruitment and stock status. A meta-analysis was conducted to quantify the independent effects of exploitation pattern and exploitation rate on current stock status. The analysis used empirical data for 38 fish stocks of 13 species in the NE Atlantic. Two metrics of exploitation pattern were used and their sensitivity was compared. As expected, exploitation rate had a significant negative effect on current stock status. Exploitation patterns associated with high proportional fishing mortality of immature fish also had a significant negative effect on current stock status, providing empirical support for the “spawn-at-least-once” principle. When the fishing mortality of immature fish exceeds half that of mature fish, stock status falls below precautionary limits. Our results suggest that a sensitive metric of exploitation pattern could provide useful information about an aspect of exploitation that is currently overlooked by fisheries management regimes that focus primarily on exploitation rate},

	abstract = {The true distribution of migrant species is rarely immediately apparent from the distribution of ring recoveries due to a heavy bias in regional recovery probabilities. For western Palearctic species, the recovery probability is especially low in Africa, but also varies within Europe. However, little work has been done to derive actual estimates of these recovery probabilities needed to infer the true underlying distribution. Here, we investigate the potential of using ringing data to estimate the seasonal distribution densities of migrant species. Using likelihoods based on a two point mixture distribution, the proportions of individuals wintering south of the Sahara are estimated using differences in recovery distributions among species in species groups where the location-specific probability of a ring recovery can be assumed to be essentially the same among species. We consider two such approaches. In the first, survival associated with a wintering area must be set constant across species. In the second, we assume the time series is long enough that a single binary response (recovered/not recovered) may be modeled independently of survival parameters. Under the first approach, we estimated the proportion of sub-Saharan migrants, together with 95\% profile likelihood confidence intervals, for redstart as 0.84 [0.70,0.93], thrush nightingale 1.00 [0.49,1.00], garden warbler 0.95 [0.85;0.99], blackcap 0.60 [0.32;0.78], reed warbler 0.87 [0.72,0.95], and pied flycatcher 0.90 [0.76;0.97] using recovery data for birds ringed in Denmark and assuming that all robins winter north of Sahara. In the second approach, estimated proportions of sub-Saharan migrants were similar, but the confidence intervals were somewhat narrower. Although further work is required to examine the underlying assumptions, the models and analyses presented here provide a framework for making better use of existing ring recovery datasets to understand the true seasonal distribution patterns of European birds},

Validation of random walk simulations is essential. There is a continuum of mathematically valid stochastic integration schemes upon which random walk simulations depend, each of which lead to radically different macro-scale dynamics as expressed in their corresponding Fokker-Planck equations. In addition, diffusivity is not a unique parameter describing a random walk and its corresponding Fokker-Planck equation. Spatially varying translation speed and turn frequency have different effects on population distributions. Validation requires extra information either in the form of the well-mixed condition for physical diffusion, or in detailed information on the sensing ability, internal state modulation and swimming response for plankton motility},

	abstract = {The use of demographic analyses incorporating life history information on validated age and growth, reproduction, and natural mortality is proposed to gain insight into the population dynamics of sharks under a variety of scenarios and to assess their vulnerability to varying exploitation rates. This approach provides a useful framework for comparison with other currently used methods of assessment, especially those that rely only on fishery-dependent data, and thus can be helpful to stock assessments and to the rational exploitation and management of shark stocks. A review of demographic analyses of large coastal sharks on the east coast of the US indicates that the lemon and sandbar sharks have very low rates of population increase (r{\textless}1.2\% year-1) and are thus extremely vulnerable to exploitation. In contrast, one of the small coastal group species of lesser importance to the fisheries, the bonnethead shark, has some of the highest r values yet calculated for any shark. Preliminary demographic analyses using nonvalidated age estimates indicate that two other common and economically valuable large coastal species, the blacktip and dusky sharks, may also exhibit relatively slow rates of population change and be very vulnerable to overexploitation. Improved assessment of shark stocks requires increased collection of biological and fishery data, and a much better understanding of their population dynamics, especially stock-recruitment relationships},

	abstract = {Sharks are found in association with main Hawaiian Island ocean fish farms more frequently and at higher densities than is typical for coastal Hawaiian waters. Sharks attracted to fish farms could potentially threaten human water users, interact negatively with other fisheries, and seasonal migrations could be disrupted if individuals become entrained around farms throughout the year. We hypothesised that smaller coastal species would reside near farms, whereas more wide-ranging species would associate with farms only for short periods. We utilised passive acoustic telemetry to monitor the movements and behaviour of sandbar (Carcharhinus plumbeus) and tiger (Galeocerdo cuvier) sharks adjacent to two open ocean fish farms in Hawaii. Approximately half the tagged sandbar sharks showed site fidelity to the farms, with some individuals being detected repeatedly for 2.5 years. Sandbar sharks moved seasonally to the west coast of Oahu, suggesting that fish farms are not disrupting natural seasonal cycles in this species. Tiger sharks tagged near the cages were more transient, and showed much shorter residence times although some individuals returned sporadically to the cages over the 3-year period. Ocean fish cages appear to aggregate sandbar sharks, but are only ‘visited’ by tiger sharks. Although threats to public safety are probably minimal, the ecological effects of aggregating top-predators are still unknown},

Most recaptures were within 100 km of the tagging location in the nursery habitat in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) with small scale movements occurring throughout the year. Forty-eight C. obscurus undertook movements {\textgreater}200 km that indicated a southerly migration between KZN and Eastern/Southern Cape (E/SC) between June and November. Seasonal northerly migrations were less well defined. The largest southerly and northerly movements were 1323 km and 1374 km, respectively. For sharks moving 1–100 km south from their tagging locality in KZN, an increase in displacement occurred between June and September identifying animals beginning their migration to the E/SC. With increasing displacement, there was also an increase in minimum swimming speed. Calculated growth rates of small sharks of 10.3–11.5 cm year–1 were in agreement with current literature values.

A maximum likelihood approach is taken to estimate movement and catchability parameters for data obtained from tagging experiments. Yield-per-recruit analysis is a critical, though often neglected, tool required to evaluate the need for international management of tunas.

In addition, there is a stochastic component, which can be defined in such a way that the entire group will tend to move in the direction towards a specified region, taken to be the spawning grounds. The model includes boundaries representing for example isotherms or depth contours where specific behaviour of individual fish can be defined.

	abstract = {The scalloped hammerhead, Sphryna lewini (Griffith \&amp; Smith, 1834), is a globally exploited species of shark. In order to gain insight into the life history of this species in the USA waters, age and growth was examined from specimens (n = 307) captured from the north-west Atlantic Ocean and from the Gulf of Mexico. The von Bertalanffy growth model resulted in growth parameters of L��P = 214.8 cm fork length (FL), k = 0.13 year–1, t0 = –1.62 year for males and L��P = 233.1 cm FL, k = 0.09 year–1, t0 = –2.22 year for females. The oldest age estimates obtained for this population were 30.5 years for both males and females, which corresponded to FL of 234 cm and 241 cm respectively. Bowker’s test of symmetry and Index of Average Per Cent Error suggests that our ageing method represents a non-biased and precise approach to the age assessment. Marginal increments were significantly different between months (Kruskal–Wallis P = 0.017) with a distinct trend of increasing monthly increment growth beginning in January. When compared to previously published studies, our growth estimates suggest slower growth than populations in the Pacific Ocean but faster growth than previously reported in the Gulf of Mexico},

Sexual conflicts were absent at the former, but were documented at the latter. Serum titers of 17+�-estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, and 5+�-dihydrotestosterone were determined via radioimmunoassay in adult male sharks from 1988 to 2000. Sampling overlap between the two institutions occurred for 3 months of the year, but steroid concentrations were compared only for April due to the occurrence of sexual conflicts in the sharks at the National Aquarium in Baltimore in that month. For April, testosterone and dihydrotestosterone were significantly higher in the SeaWorld males, and progesterone was significantly higher in the National Aquarium in Baltimore males, while estradiol was not significantly different. Steroid levels were also determined from serial samples taken monthly over 17 months from three male sharks and one female shark at the National Aquarium in Baltimore in 2001–2002 and were compared with corresponding observed sexual conflicts. The steroid levels obtained showed distinct annual hormonal cycles in the male sharks and corroborated a biennial cycle for the single serially-sampled female shark. Furthermore, the steroid levels for individual males correlated with sexual conflicts as well as their position within the male dominance hierarchy. As this species is depleted in some regions globally, insight into the steroid profile of mature sand tiger sharks is important for a greater understanding of the relationship between their reproductive physiology and behavior, and may aid in captive management and reproduction},

	abstract = {I quantify the effects of 11 variables on the catchability and fishing power of pelagic longlines, which are used to catch tunas and billfishes in the open ocean. Extension of the depth range and the duration of longline operations have reduced the catchability of several epipelagic species, such as mako sharks (Isurus spp.), since industrial longlining commenced in the tropical Pacific Ocean in the early 1950s. Reductions in the body size of many species may also have reduced encounters with longline hooks. By contrast, the catchability of commercially valuable bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) increased substantially because of the longer duration and extension of the depth range of longlines. Stronger and less visible line materials and increased fishing-master experience also contributed to increased catchability. By affecting the rate of bait loss, the introduction of new bait species increased fishing power. This study highlights significant problems in deriving indices of abundance from commercial catch and effort data. Instead of relying on commercial data, assessments should use tag-recapture experiments or dedicated surveys to obtain fishery-independent estimates of abundance},

	abstract = {Limited data are a common challenge posed to fisheries stock assessment. A simulation framework was applied to examine the impact of limited data and data type on the performance of a widely used catch-at-age stock-assessment method (Stock Synthesis). The estimation method provided negatively biased estimates of current spawning-stock biomass (SSB) relative to the unfished level (final depletion) when only recent survey indices were available. Estimation of quantities of management interest (unfished SSB, virgin recruitment, target fishing mortality and final depletion) improved substantially even when only minimal-length-composition data from the survey were available. However, the estimates of some quantities (final depletion and unfished SSB) remained biased (either positively or negatively) even in the scenarios with the most data (length compositions, age compositions and survey indices). The probability of overestimating yield at the target SSB relative to the true such yield was  ̃50\%, a risk-neutral result, for all the scenarios that included length-composition data. Our results highlight the importance of length-composition data for the performance of an age-structured assessment model, and are encouraging for the assessment of data-limited stocks},

Relative biomass of krill feeders (i.e. minke whales, whale sharks, manta rays) were related to SST, Chl-a and bathymetry (model [AICc] weight = 0.45) and the model combining these variables explained a relatively large amount (32.3\%) of the variation in relative biomass. Relative biomass of fish/cephalopod feeders (dolphins, sharks) were weakly correlated with changes in SST, whereas that of other invertebrate/macroalgal feeders (turtles, dugong) was weakly correlated with changes in steepness of the shelf (bathymetry gradient).

The index of relative importance (IRI) revealed a highly specialized diet, consisting entirely of cephalopod molluscs (99-+6\% IRI) and crustaceans (0-+4\% IRI). Benthic octopus (Octopoda) dominated the diet, accounting for 96-+7\% IRI. A highly significant difference was found between the stomach contents of juvenile and sub-adult and adult Australian weasel sharks. Dietary specialization increased with ontogeny and fish ≥1000 mm in total length (LT) fed almost exclusively on octopus (98\% IRI). A highly significant difference was found between the LT of Australian weasel sharks from coral and sand and seagrass sites. At the coral site 75-+4\% of fish were mature while at the sand and seagrass site only 16-+1\% were mature. This spatial segregation may be attributed to shifting energy requirements associated with ontogeny and the relative abundance of large octopus at the coral site.

However, tag non-reporting, short-term tag shedding, and short-term tag-induced mortality cause potentially large bias in population parameter estimates using standard models of exploitation rate (Petersen) and movement (Hilborn). Here, I review estimators of mortality and movement rates that are not biased by these tag loss effects. Mortality can be estimated using the times-at-large of recaptures. The reciprocal of the mean time-at-large of recaptured fish is the maximum likelihood estimate of instantaneous total mortality rate. Chapman refined this to derive a time-at-large mortality rate estimate that is both finite-sample unbiased and minimum variance, thus statistically optimal. With movement estimation, a constant non-reporting rate, by appearing top and bottom in a “recapture-conditioned” model, cancels from the likelihood. Non-reporting rate thereby disappears from the estimator and so is not required to estimate fish movement rates. Tag shedding and tag-induced mortality rates also cancel. These mortality and movement estimators do not use the number of animals tagged and released; using only information from recaptured animals, they are denoted “recapture-conditioned.” Recapture-conditioned estimators offer relatively unbiased single-tag recovery data analysis tools that, to date, have gone largely unnoticed},

This workwas a technical background to the development of a core set of indicators sought by the Ministry for the Environment. It has led, through an extensive programme of consultation, to a set of confirmed indicators. The initial proposals and their basis are described together with their relationship to the confirmed indicators. The proposed indicators could readily be calculated as part of the stock assessments conducted annually by the Ministry of Fisheries and this is recommended. For many stocks, especially minor stocks, only proxies for the preferred indicators would be possible. The proxy indicators would not be useful in all cases, and target or threshold values for them could generally not be calculated. Shortcomings and difficulties in the proposed indicators are described. A state indicator that separates changes induced by fishing from those of a natural origin is described, but it could be obtained for only a few stocks.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The method used to estimate current fishing mortality (FCUR) is based on a form of catch-curve analysis that accounts for selectivity. A harvest control rule that incorporates limit and target fishing mortality levels is used to calculate the following year's intended fishing mortality based on the estimate of FCUR. This is then used to adjust a reference catch to calculate the following year's recommended catch. The performance of this new harvest strategy in relation to defined management objectives is tested by management strategy evaluation for two example species with different life-history characteristics. The simulation results show that a harvest strategy using equilibrium assessment methods such as catch-curves can perform reasonably well when used in combination with an appropriate catch averaging period, and a suitable harvest control rule},

The model includes a factor for vessel/vessel group as a means of adjusting for fishing power effects. Area, season, vessel and year are shown to have a significant effect on CPUE. Interactions between these main effects are investigated for a smaller model with grouped levels of each factor. Significant interactions are identified between the effects of year, season, vessel group and, to a lesser extent, area, but the variation in CPUE explained by each effect is small in comparison to the variation explained by main effects. Estimates of annual CPUE extracted from a main effects model (i.e. assuming no interactions) are shown to have a broadly similar trend to that observed in CPUE indices calculated using traditional rectangle and month averaging procedures. Some of the more obvious biases found in traditional indices are avoided. Approximately 60\% of the total observed variation in CPUE was not explained by the model, and it is suggested that analysis of CPUE data disaggregated by age may be appropriate},

	abstract = {Stock identification has been an important prerequisite for stock assessment throughout its history. The earliest evaluations of recruitment variability recognized that understanding the spatial scale of a fishery resource is essential for studying population dynamics. A paradigm of stock structure was based on closed migration circuits and geographic variation of phenotypic traits and formed a premise for fishery modeling conventions in the mid-1900s. As genetic techniques developed in the late 1900s, the stock concept was refined to include a degree of reproductive isolation. Realization that there was no single method that addressed the various assumptions of stock assessment and needs of fishery management prompted a more holistic view of population structure that called for multiple sources of demographic and genetic data. Recent applications of advanced techniques challenge the traditional view of populations as geographically distinct units with homogeneous vital rates and isolation from adjacent resources. More complex concepts such as metapopulations and contingent theory may be more applicable to many fishery resources with sympatric population structure. These more complex patterns of population structure have been incorporated into some advanced stock assessment techniques and metapopulation models that account for movement among areas and sympatric heterogeneity. Wider application of spatially explicit models in future stock assessments will require clear identification of stock components, evaluating movement rates and determining the degree of reproductive isolation. Because spatial structure affects how populations respond to fisheries, incorporation of heterogeneous patterns and movement in stock assessment models should improve advice for fishery management},

These models require a size–transition matrix that specifies the probabilities of growing from one size-class to the others. Many methods exist to estimate size–transition matrices using tag–recapture data. However, they have not been compared in a systematic way. Eight of these methods are compared using Monte Carlo simulations parameterised using the data for the tiger prawn (Penaeus semisulcatus). Four of the methods are then applied to tag–recapture data for three prawn species in Australia’s Northern Prawn Fishery to highlight the considerable sensitivity of model outputs to the method for estimating the size–transition matrix. The simulations show that not all methods perform equally well and that some methods are extremely poor. The ‘best’ methods, as identified in the simulations, are those that allow for individual variability in the parameters of the growth curve as well as the age-at-release. A method that assumes that l��P rather than k varies among individuals tends to be more robust to violations of model assumptions},

	url = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF10219},
	abstract = {Biotelemetry is an increasingly popular and effective tool to study fish movements. Interpretation of the results relies on the assumption that fish behaviour and physiology is not affected by the presence of the tag. Although the long-term effects of tagging should be evaluated before field telemetry studies, this has rarely been quantified. As a precursor to a long-term telemetry study on Argyrosomus japonicus (Termminck and Schlegel 1843) in South Africa, the effects of surgical implantation of two different-sized tags were assessed in a 256-day experiment. We hypothesised that the larger 13-mm-diameter tags, which exceeded the general 2\% tag-to-body mass rule, would have adverse effects on growth, survival and tag retention compared with the smaller 9-mm-diameter tags and an untagged control group. Because no adverse effects in growth were observed among the three groups, nor any long-term tag-related mortality, tag expulsion or internal damage, we suggest that the general 2\% tag-to-body mass rule should be regarded only as a broad guide. Further, we conclude that juvenile A. japonicus individuals are well suited for surgical implantation of commercially available 9- and 13-mm-diameter tags and are good candidates for long-term telemetry studies},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Animal tracking is a growing field in ecology and previous work has shown that simple speed filtering of tracking data is not sufficient and that improvement of tracking location estimates are possible. To date, this has required methods that are complicated and often time-consuming (state-space models), resulting in limited application of this technique and the potential for analysis errors due to poor understanding of the fundamental framework behind the approach. We describe and test an alternative and intuitive approach consisting of bootstrapping random walks biased by forward particles. The model uses recorded data accuracy estimates, and can assimilate other sources of data such as sea-surface temperature, bathymetry and/or physical boundaries. We tested our model using ARGOS and geolocation tracks of elephant seals that also carried GPS tags in addition to PTTs, enabling true validation. Among pinnipeds, elephant seals are extreme divers that spend little time at the surface, which considerably impact the quality of both ARGOS and light-based geolocation tracks. Despite such low overall quality tracks, our model provided location estimates within 4.0, 5.5 and 12.0 km of true location 50\% of the time, and within 9, 10.5 and 20.0 km 90\% of the time, for above, equal or below average elephant seal ARGOS track qualities, respectively. With geolocation data, 50\% of errors were less than 104.8 km (\&lt;0.94A�), and 90\% were less than 199.8 km (\&lt;1.80A�). Larger errors were due to lack of sea-surface temperature gradients. In addition we show that our model is flexible enough to solve the obstacle avoidance problem by assimilating high resolution coastline data. This reduced the number of invalid on-land location by almost an order of magnitude. The method is intuitive, flexible and efficient, promising extensive utilization in future research.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {We present a process-based approach to estimate residency and behavior from uncertain and temporally correlated movement data collected with electronic tags. The estimation problem is formulated as a hidden Markov model (HMM) on a spatial grid in continuous time, which allows straightforward implementation of barriers to movement. Using the grid to explicitly resolve space, location estimation can be supplemented by or based entirely on environmental data (e.g. temperature, daylight). The HMM method can therefore analyze any type of electronic tag data. The HMM computes the joint posterior probability distribution of location and behavior at each point in time. With this, the behavioral state of the animal can be associated to regions in space, thus revealing migration corridors and residence areas. We demonstrate the inferential potential of the method by analyzing satellite-linked archival tag data from a southern bluefin tuna Thunnus maccoyii where longitudinal coordinates inferred from daylight are supplemented by latitudinal information in recorded sea surface temperatures},

Data were collected and processed for a total of 341 days, including 33 days for one recaptured fish specimen, allowing high-resolution archived data to be downloaded. The fish spent most of their time in the mixed layer but undertook dives down to 888 m. Ambient temperatures ranged between 4.6 and 24.1-�C, and the sea surface temperatures recorded ranged from 13.4 to 24.1-�C during the study period. No clear diel pattern in depth behavior was observed, but mean vertical distribution was deeper during the daytime. Moreover, a foraging pattern, consisting of rapid descents below the thermocline followed by slower ascents, was generally observed during daylight hours. Dissolved oxygen concentration and water temperature seem to be the main factors affecting the vertical range of the species in the area.

	abstract = {The roundel skate (Raja texana) inhabits near-shore waters throughout the Gulf of Mexico. Despite such a wide distribution, very little is known about its biology. In order to gain insight into the life history of this species, the age, growth and maturity of 231 skates ranging in size from 277 to 630-mm total length (TL) were examined. Based on vertebral band counts, the oldest age estimates obtained were 8 years for males and 9 for females, which corresponded to 495-mm TL and 630-mm TL respectively. Age-bias plots and coefficient of variation suggested that our ageing method represents a non-biased and precise approach to age assessment. Marginal increment and edge analyses suggested that growth bands are formed annually with a distinct trend of increasing growth at the beginning of March. Back calculations suggested a birth size of 113–118-mm TL. Observed and back-calculated length-at-age data were used to assess growth with four different models, including the von Bertalanffy (VBGM), von Bertalanffy with size at birth (VB with L 					0), Gompertz and Francis models. Male and female growth was significantly different. The VBGM and the Francis model produced similar results and provided the best fit. Curves fitted with observed and back-calculated data suggested slightly faster growth than curves fitted with only observed data. Maturity occurred at 444-mm TL and 4.95 years for males, whereas females matured at 537-mm TL and 5.8 years},

	abstract = {The hypothesis of the [`]Phenomenon of Apparent Change in Growth Rate' caused by length-selective fishing mortality is adopted for explaining observed differences in published von Bertalanffy growth curves for gummy shark (Mustelus antarcticus) determined from length-at-age data. Three independent pieces of evidence are presented in support of this hypothesis to explain the differences in the curves between 1973-76 and 1986-87 in Bass Strait and between Bass Strait and South Australia during 1986-87: (1) Mean length of the sharks in each of the ages-classes 3-7 years are shown to be different between the two periods and the two regions, but not different for the 2-year age-class which is affected less than the older age-classes by the fishing gear deployed in the fishery. (2) Avoiding the pitfalls of [`]back-calculation', Rosa Lee's Phenomenon was detected by directly comparing the radii of growth-increment bands visible on the faces of the articular cups of vertebral centra from sharks of various ages caught in the two periods and the two regions. Statistical tests indicated that the degree of Rosa Lee's Phenomenon did not vary significantly between the periods or regions. (3) Through development of an appropriate model, the effects of length-selective fishing mortality on the mean length of sharks in the wild population for age-classes 2-16 years were simulated for a range of levels of hook and gillnet fishing effort, with separate mesh-sizes of 6 and 7�in. for the gillnets. Simulated changes in mean length for sharks older than two years tended to be smaller than the differences observed in the published von Bertalanffy growth curves but they were generally consistent with the observed trends. The simulations demonstrated how the magnitude of the von Bertalanffy growth parameters L[infinity] and t0 tend to increase and K tends to decrease as gillnet fishing effort increases, and hence explain how these types of biases, commonly appearing in the scientific literature for gillnet shark fisheries, can occur. The simulations also demonstrate that hook fishing effort in a fishery with legal minimum lengths has to be very high to cause distortion of growth curves},

	abstract = {Tunas are known to be able to travel long distances. The aim of this paper is to propose new ethological models which reproduce some tuna movements using the dynamics of their environment. We use sea surface temperature animations (from remote sensing data) to model the South West Indian Ocean, and French purse seiners data are used to estimate movements of fish. The objective of the models will be to find a northern movement from the Mozambique Channel to the Seychelles Islands at the appropriate time (May-July). The initial model uses our ecological knowledge of tunas, i.e. the search behavior for high concentrations of food commonly associated with thermal fronts. In some cases, this simple model creates some northern movements from the Mozambique Channel, but it cannot be used to reproduce large-scale movements between the Mozambique Channel and the Seychelles Islands. The next generation model is created where tuna behaviors are modeled by an artificial neural network, using a genetic algorithm to adjust the connection weights. The tuna school-network receives daily information from its local environment and chooses the best actions in order to be able to pass from the Mozambique Channel to the Seychelles Islands at the appropriate time. One neural network emerges and represents an adaptive behavior able to interpret daily sea surface temperatures to mimic large-scale tuna movements. This artificial behavior can be generalized to each possible departure position from the Mozambique Channel. This modelling represents a new tool to study large-scale movements of pelagic fish, and is a first step towards real-time management of fisheries},

	abstract = {The present study focuses on age estimation, with reproductive information contributing to the better understanding of the growth and the biology of Raja undulata. In the age and growth study, two calcified structures were used: caudal thorns and central vertebra. Results of readings showed that there were no significant differences in age estimates between the two structures. Both von Bertalanffy and Gompertz growth models were fitted to size-at-age data by sex and geographical area. No significant differences were found between sexes for the two models but significant differences were found between geographical areas (P = 0.05). The Gompertz growth function was selected as the best model to describe R. undulata growth because it presented the best fit and the most reasonable biological estimates. Reproductive analysis indicates one annual breeding season for R. undulata. The differences found in the estimates of length at first maturity between geographical areas (TL50\% = 838 mm in Peniche and 762 mm in Algarve for females and TL50\% = 781 mm in Peniche and 736 mm in Algarve for males), together with the regional differences found between growth parameters estimates (P = 0.05), may reflect the existence of different local populations of R. undulata on the Portuguese continental shelf},

	abstract = {Training is a fundamental part of all scientific and technical disciplines. This is particularly true for all types of surgeons. For surgical procedures, a number of skills are necessary to reduce mistakes. Trainees must learn an extensive yet standardized set of problem-solving and technical skills to handle challenges as they arise. There are currently no guidelines or consistent training methods for those intending to implant electronic tags in fish; this is surprising, considering documented cases of negative consequences of fish surgeries and information from studies having empirically tested fish surgical techniques. Learning how to do fish surgery once is insufficient for ensuring the maintenance or improvement of surgical skill. Assessment of surgical skills is rarely incorporated into training, and is needed. Evaluation provides useful feedback that guides future learning, fosters habits of self-reflection and self-remediation, and promotes access to advanced training. Veterinary professionals should be involved in aspects of training to monitor basic surgical principles. We identified attributes related to knowledge, understanding, and skill that surgeons must demonstrate prior to performing fish surgery including a hands-on assessment using live fish. Included is a summary of common problems encountered by fish surgeons. We conclude by presenting core competencies that should be required as well as outlining a 3-day curriculum for training surgeons to conduct intracoelomic implantation of electronic tags. This curriculum could be offered through professional fisheries societies as professional development courses},

In addition, we detail rates of data loss, changes in data quality over time and variation in data quality from solar-powered satellite-tags deployed on ducks in Australia and Papua New Guinea. Up to 68\% of all locational fixes have a nominal accuracy of less than 1 km, and satellite-tags deployed on wild birds can provide up to 22 location fixes per day and store enough energy during the day to run continuously throughout the night},

	abstract = {Many species of chondrichthyans (sharks, rays and chimaeras) reproduce throughout the year, lacking a distinct seasonality in the timing of their reproduction with young born throughout the year. Since age determination in fish usually relies on counting regularly deposited growth increments on hard body parts (e.g. vertebrae, spines, otoliths) the age of an aseasonally reproducing animal after the first growth increment is formed is unknown. We explored the implications of this for the estimation of growth and maturity parameters using the milk shark, Rhizoprionodon acutus, a small, tropical, shark that reproduces aseasonally off northern Australia. Since R. acutus grows rapidly after birth, not accounting for an aseasonal reproductive cycle led to unrealistic projections of growth for this species. We describe a simple method for adjusting individual ages that improves projections of growth and reduces the level of error around growth parameter estimates. This is compared with growth estimates when ages are left unadjusted or adjusted to a mean value to account for aseasonal reproduction. Using back calculated length-at-age data, model-averaged growth across five models gave an asymptotic size (L[infinity]) of 859�mm for females and 821�mm for males. Standard von Bertalanffy growth parameters were L[infinity]�=�861�mm, K�=�0.63, L0�=�423�mm for females and L[infinity]�=�821�mm, K�=�0.94, L0�=�424�mm for males. The oldest female and male were 8.1 and 4.5 years old, and the largest female and male measured were 940 and 931�mm. The size at which 50\% of females and males were mature was 780 and 742�mm. The age at which 50\% of females and males were mature was 1.8 and 1.1 years of age. Incorporating the effects of an aseasonal reproductive cycle into growth analysis is an important step for maximising the accuracy of age and growth results and is especially important for small, tropical species such as R. acutus that complete much of their growth in the first year of life},

	abstract = {Bite damage patterns have long been used to estimate shark species and body size, with somewhat limited success. The lack of fit between damage patterns and shark size is partially due to variation in tooth size and shape within an individual. The ability to accurately predict body size from bite patterns is important for better understanding the ecological and behavioral underpinnings of shark bites/attacks on marine organisms, humans, and submarine equipment. To this end, we measured interdental distance (IDD) between the most labial teeth in the first six tooth files on both the upper and lower jaws, as well as the circumference of the portion of each jaw that bears teeth, for prepared jaw sets from fourteen shark species and regressed these data against total length. IDD is allometric as well as an accurate predictor of total length in all species examined, except Carcharhinus acronotus . Tooth-bearing circumference is also allometric and predictive of total length in all species. Though considerable overlap exists in IDD and circumference ranges among species for the total length ranges examined, Carcharodon carcharias and Isurus sp. can be differentiated from Carcharhinus limbatus , Carcharhinus brevipinna , and C. acronotus based on these values alone. When combined with knowledge of species-specific feeding behavior, geographic distribution, and habitat preferences, these simple measures from bite damage patterns allow quick, accurate assessment of shark size and potential species},

Spatial predictions of blue shark (Prionace glauca) catch rate and catch probability of juveniles in the Southwest Atlantic. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 68: 890–900. Generalized regression analysis and spatial prediction was applied to catch per unit effort (cpue) data for blue shark (Prionace glauca) caught by the Brazilian tuna longline fleet between 1997 and 2008 (43 546 longline sets) to predict the effect of environmental, spatial, and temporal factors on catch distribution. In addition, the size distribution of blue sharks measured by on-board observers during the years 2006–2008 was used to model the proportion of juvenile blue sharks in the catches from a spatial perspective. Latitude was the most important factor influencing blue shark cpue in the Southwest Atlantic, with cpue spatial predictions suggesting two areas of higher catch probabilities. Latitude was also the most important factor influencing the proportion of juveniles in the catches. The spatial prediction map showed that juveniles were more frequently caught south of 35-�S (��+38-�S). This information can assist in the design of management strategies either to exploit this predictable spatial distribution of the catch or to manage the fisheries in a spatially explicit manner if one component (i.e. juveniles) requires protective measures},

The relative survival did not differ between the three groups (control, antennae and no antennae), but the specific growth of the two tagged groups were lower than that of the control fish. The tag:body-mass ratio had a significant negative effect on specific growth. A relative high occurrence of tag expulsion was observed in both treatment groups (23\%). The probability to expel a tag was correlated with the tag:body-mass ratio. Finally, the relative survival, growth, expulsion rate and general condition were compared between fish tagged with different types of suture material (absorbable v. non-absorbable).

In total, 6309 shortfin mako sharks were tagged, of which 730 were recaptured. The high recapture rate of 11-+6\% for this species provided adequate recapture data to carry out survival analyses. Estimates of survival were generated with the computer software MARK, which provided a means for estimating parameters from tagged animals when they were recaptured. The results of several models are presented with various combinations of constant and time-specific survival and recovery rates. A parametric bootstrap and the median variance inflation factor () approach were used to test the fit of the general model to the data. The estimated indicated a very good model fit. The models with time invariant survival rate had the most support from the data and no group or time period effects were found. Recovery rate (f) appeared to increase from 0-+043 in the early years to 0-+056 in the later years. The nominal survival rate of 0-+59 year−1 was adjusted with an estimated tag-shedding rate of 0-+26 year−1 to generate a final corrected annual survival estimate of 0-+79 with a 95\% CI of 0-+71–0-+87},

We propose in this paper a simple method that only requires computing the mean length of a sample of trajectories in some bounded area to distinguish between these two kinds of movement. We show through simulations that the method allows to detect the presence of heterogeneities that orient animal movement. We apply it to experimental trajectories of Messor sancta ants engaged in corpse aggregation to show that their displacement is oriented at the contact of the formed corpse piles and that their trajectories become non-diffusive},

	abstract = {Distribution, biology and fishery importance of the pencil shark, \textit{Hypogaleus hyugaensis}, off Western Australia was investigated using data from fishery observers and commercial fisheries landings. Observers collected data from 1823 gillnet sets and examined 516 specimens. The sex ratio was even and the majority of animals were greater than 84 cm fork length (FL). The size at maturity for males was estimated to be 82 cm FL, and for females to be 82-90 cm FL. Females have a two-year reproductive cycle. Ovulation occurs from March to May, with parturition probably occurring after a gestation period of less than 12 months. The size at birth was estimated to be 30-32 cm FL. Litter size ranged from 2 to 15, with a mean of 9.6. Pelagic teleosts and squid dominated the diet. Highest catch rates based on observer data occurred at depths between 50 and 80 m. Landings data indicate that \textit{H. hyugaensis} make up approximately 0.5\% of the shark catch in the fisheries off Western Australia. Steady catch rates since 1989 suggests that the fishery has had no impact on the population. Landings data and observer catch rate data show different patterns of seasonal and geographic distribution. However, landings data are probably unrepresentative of actual catches in the fisheries due to problems with identification and discarding.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The reproductive cycle of Trygonorrhina fasciata females in south-western Australian waters is shown to include a protracted period of embryonic diapause or delayed development. This characteristic is typically regarded as enabling young to be born when conditions are optimal. The birth of T. fasciata occurs in April/May, when water temperatures are still high and conducive to rapid growth. Furthermore, because gut fullness in this and subsequent months was similar to other times of the year, the prey of neonates, i.e. mysids, carids, pinnotherids, amphipods and isopods, were presumably abundant in that period. Ovulation occurs in April/May and embryos grow rapidly between December and birth in April/May. Females grew to greater lengths than males, i.e. 1460 v. 890 mm, and matured (L50) at larger lengths, i.e. 892 v. 678 mm respectively. As body size increased, teleosts, pilumnid and portunid crabs and molluscs became important dietary components. Overall, the diet consisted predominantly of crustaceans, fish, polychaetes and molluscs, with volumetric contributions of 73.4, 17.2, 5.3 and 2.8\% respectively. Dietary composition underwent a cyclical seasonal change and differed among locations, indicating some degree of opportunistic feeding. Interspecific comparisons indicate that benthic food resources are partitioned among and within the main batoid species in south-western Australian waters},

Archival tags promise the ability to help uncover long-term movement patterns at the individual level, if the tags can be retained and recovered from healthy fish. We examined fifteen individuals (69–90-�cm fork length) for long-term physiological response to intracoelomic implantation of three types of archival tags: fully internal, internal with right angle protruding light stalk, and internal with straight protruding light stalk. Tags represented 0.05–0.16\% of initial fish weights. Fish were reared at 10.8-�-�-�1.1-�C for 59-�weeks post-surgery. One fish died after 39-�weeks from thermal stress unrelated to the surgical procedure. Temporal variation in behavior of tagged fish was indistinguishable from that of controls (n-�=-�15 tagged, 5 controls). Treatment and control-group fish grew at similar rates. No tag expulsion or physiological response was evident in the individual that died at 39-�weeks, but nine of eleven individuals dissected at the end of 59-�weeks had developed internal responses. These responses ranged from deposition of fibrous protein and/or calcitic material on tag surfaces to partial or full tag encapsulation in either the visceral peritoneal layer (fully-internal tags) or the intestinal mesenteries (stalk-bearing tags). The responses were within the range reported for other pleuronectids implanted with tags of similar configuration and may have implications for design and interpretation of long-term tagging studies. Encapsulation may reduce the probability of tag recoveries even in the absence of tag expulsion, especially in species eviscerated at sea},

	abstract = {Spatial scale is an important factor that needs to be considered in data collection and analysis in ecological studies. Studies focusing on the quantitative evaluation of impacts of spatial scales are, however, limited in fisheries. Using the Chinese squid-jigging fishery in the north-western Pacific Ocean as an example, we evaluated impacts of spatial scale used in grouping fisheries and environmental data on the standardisation of fisheries catch per unit effort (CPUE). We developed 18 scenarios of different spatial scales with a combination of three latitudinal levels (0.5-�, 1-� and 2-�) and six longitudinal levels (0.5-�, 1-�, 2-�, 3-�, 4-� and 5-�) to aggregate the data. We then applied generalised additive models to analyse the 18 scenarios of data for the CPUE standardisation, and quantified differences among the scenarios. This study shows that longitudinal and latitudinal spatial scale and size of the spatial area for data aggregation can greatly influence the standardisation of CPUE. We recommend that similar studies be undertaken whenever possible to evaluate the roles of spatial scales and to identify the optimal spatial scale for data aggregations in the standardisation of CPUE and fisheries stock assessment},

	volume = {19},
	abstract = {Investigations into population structure have been at the forefront of fisheries research for decades, yet it is generally ignored in stock assessment models. As the complex nature of marine population structure has been uncovered, models have attempted to accurately portray it through the development of spatially explicit assessments that allow for movement between sub-populations. Although current tag-integrated movement models are highly complex, many arose from the relatively simple models of Beverton and Holt (1957). This article traces the historical development of these models and compares their features. Originally estimation of movement utilized only tag-recapture models, but now tag-integrated assessment models incorporate several sources of fishery, survey, and tag-recapture information to inform movement estimates. As spatial management measures become more widely used, it is increasingly important that assessment models include the spatial complexities of population structure and patterns of fishery removals, in order for more reliable monitoring of population rebuilding to take place. A generalized metapopulation model is proposed for use in fisheries stock assessment, which allows for adult movement among spatially discrete sub-populations. The input requirements for the model include region-specific catch-at-age, a tag-recapture dataset, and auxiliary information, such as a fishery-independent abundance index},

Deployments ranged from 5.4 to 8.2 months. Two predominant vertical patterns were described. The first was a bimodal vertical pattern with time spent at the surface and at depth, which was observed while traveling. The second was a repetitive oscillatory diving mode displayed by sharks in the Shared Offshore Foraging Area (SOFA). For all four datasets the average maximum daily dive depths ranged from 442.5 to 492.8 m and were typically associated with dissolved oxygen concentrations of above 1.7 ml L$^{\textrm{−1}}$. Although infrequent, occasional dives to near 1000 m with a minimum temperature of 3.9-�C and a minimum O$_{\textrm{2}}$ level of 0.3 ml L$^{\textrm{−1}}$ were observed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}/sec{\textgreater}{\textless}sec{\textgreater} {\textless}title{\textgreater}Conclusions/Significance{\textless}/title{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Recovered pop-up satellite tags from Guadalupe Island white sharks advance our understanding of the vertical habitat use of white sharks while offshore. The bimodal vertical pattern during traveling is most likely related to geolocation. The oscillatory dive pattern is likely associated with foraging. While feeding is not documented, foraging is likely occurring in association with the deep scattering layer. Diving depths were not limited by temperature but were constrained by O$_{\textrm{2}}$ levels below approximately 1.5 ml L$^{\textrm{−1}}$. While oxygen may limit the extent of sharks' vertical movements, it will also impact prey distribution. Consequently, the shallow oxygen minimum zone in the SOFA may act to concentrate prey, thus enhancing foraging opportunities in these oligotrophic waters.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}/sec{\textgreater}},

In this study, a novel photographic tethering device was used to make digital recordings of predation events on juveniles of the spiny lobster, Jasus edwardsii. Predation of lobsters was significantly higher during the day (76\%) than at night (33.4\%). This was consistent with a SCUBA survey that found greater numbers of diurnal predators than nocturnal predators at the study site. However, the abundance of predators was not consistent with the number of predation events for individual species as recorded by the photographic tethering device. The snapper, Pagrus auratus, was the most abundant species at the study site (45\% of all diurnally active fishes), but was only responsible for 12\% of predation events during the day. In contrast, wrasse species were responsible for the greatest number of predation events during the day (60\%), yet made up only a small proportion of the diurnal fish population (25\%). The results of this study indicate the importance of determining the identity of potential predators, through the use of a photographic tethering device, for increasing the value of results generated from tethering experiments},

Fish retained tags for up to 85 days (median = 30 days). Based on geolocation data from initial tagging location to pop-off location, C. leucas generally travelled c. 5–6 km day−1 and travelled an average of 143-+6 km. Overall, mean proportions of time at depth revealed C. leucas spent the majority of their time in waters {\textless}20 m. They exhibited significant differences among depths but were not found at a particular depth regardless of diurnal period. Most fish occupied temperatures c. 32-� C with individuals found mostly between 26 and 33-� C. Geolocation data for C. leucas were generally poor and varied considerably but tracks for two individuals revealed long distance movements. One fish travelled from the south-east coast of the U.S. to coastal Texas near Galveston while another moved up the east coast of the U.S. to South Carolina. Data on C. leucas movements indicated that they are found primarily in shallower waters and tend to remain in the same location over long periods. While some individuals made large-scale movements over open ocean areas, the results emphasize the importance of the coastal zone for this species as potential essential habitat, particularly in areas of high freshwater inflow},

	abstract = {One of the biggest challenges of fisheries research is reducing the bycatch of unwanted species. The incidental fishing mortality of species with low reproductive rates, such as elasmobranchs (sharks, skates, and rays), is recognized as a key threat for their populations. In the present study, gear modifications related to the type of hook and position of the hook in the water column were tested to examine their effects on catch rates and mortality of elasmobranch species in both pelagic and coastal environments. Comparisons between circle (size 18/0, 0� offset) and J-style (size 9/0, 10� offset) hooks demonstrated that the circle hooks have a greater efficiency in reducing the mortality of most species caught, both in pelagic and coastal longline fisheries. Internal lodging of the hook was significantly less frequent for the individuals caught with circle hooks, which likely contributed to their higher survival rate at haulback. Additionally, circle hooks also increased the CPUE of elasmobranchs caught in the pelagic longline fishery, which was particularly evident for Carcharhinus falciformis and Prionace glauca. The position of the hook in the water column exhibited a strong influence on the species caught in the coastal bottom longline fishery. Suspending hooks in the middle of the water column reduced the bycatch of common demersal species, such as Carcharhinus acronotus, Ginglymostoma cirratum, and Dasyatis americana, while increasing the CPUE of potentially aggressive species, such as Galeocerdo cuvier and Carcharhinus leucas. The interaction of the type of hook utilized with its position in the water column appears to be an essential factor in the optimization of longline selectivity and minimization of bycatch mortality},

	abstract = {Effort management has been proposed as an alternative for quota management in mixed demersal fisheries. It requires a metric to estimate the fishing mortality imposed by a given quantity of nominal fishing effort. Here, we estimate the partial fishing mortality rate imposed by one unit of fishing effort (Fpue) during individual fishing trips and explore the usefulness of this indicator for managing North Sea beam trawlers {\textgreater}300 hp targeting sole (Solea solea) and plaice (Pleuronectes platessa). Fpue is positively related to vessel engine power, and increased annually by 2.8\% (sole) and 1.6\% (plaice). The positive trend was due to an increase in skipper skills and investment in auxiliary equipment, the replacement of old vessels by new ones and, to a lesser extent, to upgrade engines. The average Fpue imposed per day at sea by a 2000 hp beam trawler was estimated to be 1.0 +� 10−5 (sole) and 0.6 +� 10−5 (plaice), and it showed substantial seasonal and spatial variations. The Fpue of sole and plaice were negatively related in summer and showed no relationship in winter. The existence of predictive seasonal and spatial patterns in Fpue opens up the possibility of fine-tuning management by directed effort restrictions and uncoupling management of plaice and sole},

	abstract = {The intracoelomic surgical implantation of electronic tags (including radio and acoustic telemetry transmitters, passive integrated transponders and archival biologgers) is frequently used for conducting studies on fish. Electronic tagging studies provide information on the spatial ecology, behavior and survival of fish in marine and freshwater systems. However, any surgical procedure, particularly one where a laparotomy is performed and the coelomic cavity is opened, has the potential to alter the survival, behavior or condition of the animal which can impair welfare and introduce bias. Given that management, regulatory and conservation decisions are based on the assumption that fish implanted with electronic tags have similar fates and behavior relative to untagged conspecifics, it is critical to ensure that best surgical practices are being used. Also, the current lack of standardized surgical procedures and reporting of specific methodological details precludes cross-study and cross-year analyses which would further progress the field of fisheries science. This compilation of papers seeks to identify the best practices for the entire intracoelomic tagging procedure including pre- and post-operative care, anesthesia, wound closure, and use of antibiotics. Although there is a particular focus on salmonid smolts given the large body of literature available on that group, other life-stages and species of fish are discussed where there is sufficient knowledge. Additional papers explore the role of the veterinarian in fish surgeries, the need for minimal standards in the training of fish surgeons, providing a call for more complete and transparent procedures, and identifying trends in procedures and research needs. Collectively, this body of knowledge should help to improve data quality (including comparability and repeatability), enhance management and conservation strategies, and maintain the welfare status of tagged fish},

	abstract = {We reviewed the literature in an attempt to determine the importance of aseptic technique when implanting electronic tags in fish. Given that there was negligible information on this topic we embarked on a study where bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) were used as a model to investigate the effects of different aseptic surgical techniques for the intracoelomic implantation of electronic tags in fish. First we tested the effects of water entry into the incision using five treatments: lake, distilled and saline water introduced into the incision, water-free controls, and non-surgery controls. For fish in the water treatments, 1-�mL of the sample was introduced into their coelom prior to incision closure. Fish were held for 10-�days to monitor survival and at the end of the study, the survivors were blood sampled and euthanized to evaluate condition and health using the health assessment index. In a second experiment, four aseptic treatments were used: non-sterile, field-based, high-grade sterility, and non-surgery controls and fish were monitored as in the first experiment. For both experiments, no differences in physiological status, health or mortality were noted among treatment groups. However, in the aseptic techniques experiment, surgical times were approximately twice as long for fish in the sterile treatment as compared to other groups and the costs of surgical supplies was greater than that of the less-sterile treatments. Although we failed to document any benefit of keeping water out of the incision or using aseptic technique for bluegill, in other situations and for other species, such approaches may be important. As such, we encourage fish surgeons practicing intracoelomic implants to attempt to prevent water entry into the coelom. We also encourage, at least some level of infection control (e.g., non-sterile gloves, clean tags and surgical tools) consistent with good veterinary practices to maintain the welfare status of tagged fish and ensure that the data from tagged fish representative of untagged conspecifics. However, the most prudent and ethical approach would be to work with veterinarians to incorporate formal sterilization procedures, equipment (e.g., sterile gloves) and aseptic technique into field surgical techniques},

Mean daily activity space was 1.42 km of river distance. The distance between 30-minute centers of activity was typically \&lt;0.1 km, suggesting limited movement over short time scales. Salinity electivity analysis demonstrated an affinity for salinities between 18 and at least 24 psu, suggesting movements are likely made in part, to remain within this range.

	abstract = {Abstract A variety of changes are occurring in the ecosystems of the North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea, but information about the mechanisms of change has been relatively limited, due in part to the region’s remoteness and subarctic conditions. Any number of ecosystem components or indicators could be used to exemplify this dilemma, but here we point to the salmon shark (Lamna ditropis, Lamnidae) as an example of a species that can potentially mediate considerable ecosystem change due to its high trophic level, but for which some basic information is lacking despite attracting some interesting research and widespread rumours and anecdotal evidence of increased abundance. Increases in the abundance of sharks such as salmon sharks in this region during the 1990s, if true, may help explain other observed changes such as declines in ocean survival rates of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp., Salmonidae) in the region and declines in some wild salmon stocks. Mechanisms that could cause salmon shark increases in Alaskan coastal waters include: (i) increases in sea temperature since the 1970s allowing distributional shifts of this species and changes in the abundance or distribution of their prey; (ii) the 1992 banning of high seas drift gillnets; and (iii) indirect fisheries effects such as competitive release of salmon sharks in the North Pacific transition region and towards the more southern geographic extent of their annual migration as the result of fishery-related reductions in blue sharks (Prionace glauca, Carcharhinidae) and other pelagic predators. The relative plausibility of these alternative explanations can be evaluated using combinations of existing ecosystem models and empirical research and monitoring programmes including local and indigenous observations},

Maximum observed lengths were 165 and 166 cm fork length (FL) for males and females respectively. The lengths at which 50\% of sharks were mature were 126.9 and 135.9 cm FL for males and females respectively. Juvenile sharks tended to occur in temperate waters, whereas mature-sized sharks predominantly occurred in tropical waters. Unlike other regions, juveniles were found in offshore continental shelf waters rather than in shallow waters of estuaries and marine embayments. Results indicated a biennial reproductive periodicity. Mating occurred during summer and autumn, and parturition took place after a 12-month gestation. Pups were born at 40 to 45 cm FL throughout most of the species’ Western Australian range. The majority of neonates were caught at temperate latitudes. Litter sizes varied between 4 and 10, with a mean of 6.5. There was a weak but statistically significant increase in litter size with maternal length. Mean embryonic sex ratio of females to males differed significantly from a one-to-one ratio},

	abstract = {The common approaches to evaluation and management of marine finfish stocks assume discrete populations. While it has long been recognized that this assumption is complicated to some degree by migrations and mixing between management units, there has been little attention paid recently to the complexity of spawning components within management units. Several marine finfish species appear to have more complex stock structure than is recognized, and in many cases, management units contain stock complexes or metapopulations with several spawning components rather than single discrete populations. Unfortunately, these spawning components are typically difficult to define from traditional fisheries data, or to discriminate by conventional stock identification techniques. Failure to recognize or to account for this complex stock structure in management, however, may lead to erosion of spawning components, with unknown ecological consequences. The management of complex fish stocks, at appropriate scales, so as to preserve stock complexity, therefore, remains a major challenge. Maintenance of the full diversity of spawning locations and times is an important aspect of topical discussions of biodiversity and marine protected areas. Consequently, the importance of stock identification will increase as a result of a new emphasis on management which takes into account stock complexity within areas traditionally assumed to contain a single stock. This new emphasis on stock complexity is necessary if management is to comply with a "precautionary approach" to fisheries management},

A collaborative framework for photo-identification and monitoring of C. taurus may greatly assist with conservation management initiatives. Images of C. taurus were sourced from public submissions to the www.spotashark.com (verified 12 February 2009) website and during targeted surveys. A computer-assisted program (I3S) was used to match the images of sharks photographically from the database. Research revealed patterns of movement, site utilisation and population structure similar to those in previous tagging studies. With the use of an underwater camera and two laser-scaling devices, 408 individual sharks were identified. Average occupancy times at two locations in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, were 308 days (Fish Rock) and 363 days (Magic Point). Seventeen individuals undertook northward or southward movements, averaging 350-�km. The present study showed that a broad-based technique for data acquisition, coupled with rigorous evaluation of photographic identifications can provide support for local research and management programs and may aid with the conservation of the C. taurus species worldwide},

	volume = {59},
	url = {http://icesjms.oxfordjournals.org/content/59/3/604.abstract},
	abstract = {The scope of this study is to identify temporal dynamics in fishing power, by deriving three different indices (IFP1, IFP2, IFP3) based on three independent methods. IFP1 is derived from the GLM analysis of the relationship between fishing mortality and fishing effort, assuming that total fishing mortality estimates from XSA (eXtended Survivors Analysis) are accurate. IFP2 is derived from the GLM analysis of the difference between the Log-CPUE of a vessel and the average Log-CPUE of a set of reference vessels, which are chosen with regards to the stability of their Log-CPUE over time. IFP3 is derived from the GLM analysis of the Log-CPUE of a vessel relative to some external survey abundance index. Particular attention is paid to the horsepower and year effects in IFP1, IFP2, and IFP3. This methodology is applied to the Danish, Dutch, English and Norwegian demersal fisheries of the North Sea. The fishing power estimated by all indices increases with horsepower, particularly in relation to target species. Despite less consensus in the estimation of annual variations in fishing power, some important features are highlighted. First, there are cases where fishing power has consistently increased over the period of investigation, possibly through an overall increase in fishing efficiency. Second, there are examples where fishing power has increased relative to one species, and remained constant or even decreased in relation to another one. In the context of mixed-species fisheries, this feature might reveal a shift in fishing tactics. Copyright 2002 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

We employ error propagation analysis to the fundamental equation relating latitude to solar elevation and time of day. Large latitude errors are caused by mathematical amplification of small errors in relating solar irradiance to solar elevation. Furthermore, the sign of these errors is such that the estimated latitude is badly biased. This analysis leads directly to a method of removing systematic error (bias) from latitude estimates in state-space track reconstruction models. Preliminary implementation of this method effectively removes all bias from latitude estimated from solar irradiance recorded by archival tags deployed both on moorings and on freely swimming tuna},

Two major, two minor and four uncommon prey groups were identified. The diet of \textit{A. rostrata} was dominated by decapod crustaceans. The Index of Relative Importance indicated that penaeid prawns and carid shrimps were the most important prey groups consumed, representing 51.84\% and 26.32\% of the diet respectively. Brachyuran crabs (12.84\%) and teleost fishes (8.86\%) were minor dietary components, while stomatopods, amphipods, isopods and squid constitute uncommon prey groups. Minor ontogenetic differences in diet were recognized, with carids significantly more important in juveniles than in adults, and penaeids, brachyurans and teleosts slightly more important in adults. The predatory activity of \textit{A. rostrata} on the benthic fauna, together with its relative abundance, suggests it may have an important role in the trophic structure of Moreton Bay.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Movement is a primary mechanism coupling animals to their environment, yet there exists little empirical analysis to test our theoretical knowledge of this basic process. We used correlated random walk (CRW) models and satellite telemetry to investigate long-distance movements of caribou, the most vagile, non-volant terrestrial vertebrate in the world. Individual paths of migratory and sedentary female caribou were quantified using measures of mean move length and angle, and net squared displacements at each successive move were compared to predictions from the models. Movements were modelled at two temporal scales. For paths recorded through one annual cycle, the CRW model overpredicted net displacement of caribou through time. For paths recorded over shorter intervals delineated by seasonal behavioural changes of caribou, there was excellent correspondence between model predictions and observations for most periods for both migratory and sedentary caribou. On the smallest temporal scale, a CRW model significantly overpredicted displacements of migratory caribou during 3 months following calving; this was also the case for sedentary caribou in late summer, and in late winter. In all cases of overprediction there was significant positive autocorrelation in turn direction, indicating that movements were more tortuous than expected. In one case of underprediction, significant negative autocorrelation of sequential turn direction was evident, indicating that migratory caribou moved in straightened paths during spring migration to calving grounds. Results are discussed in light of known migration patterns and possible limiting factors for caribou, and indicate the applicability of CRW models to animal movement at vast spatial and temporal scales, thus assisting in future development of more sophisticated models of population spread and redistribution for vertebrates},

	abstract = {Early approaches to surgical implantation of electronic tags in fish were often through trial and error, however, in recent years there has been an interest in using scientific research to identify techniques and procedures that improve the outcome of surgical procedures and determine the effects of tagging on individuals. Here we summarize the trends in 108 peer-reviewed electronic tagging effect studies focused on intracoleomic implantation to determine opportunities for future research. To date, almost all of the studies have been conducted in freshwater, typically in laboratory environments, and have focused on biotelemetry devices. The majority of studies have focused on salmonids, cyprinids, ictalurids and centrarchids, with a regional bias towards North America, Europe and Australia. Most studies have focused on determining whether there is a negative effect of tagging relative to control fish, with proportionally fewer that have contrasted different aspects of the surgical procedure (e.g., methods of sterilization, incision location, wound closure material) that could advance the discipline. Many of these studies included routine endpoints such as mortality, growth, healing and tag retention, with fewer addressing sublethal measures such as swimming ability, predator avoidance, physiological costs, or fitness. Continued research is needed to further elevate the practice of electronic tag implantation in fish in order to ensure that the data generated are relevant to untagged conspecifics (i.e., no long-term behavioural or physiological consequences) and the surgical procedure does not impair the health and welfare status of the tagged fish. To that end, we advocate for (1) rigorous controlled manipulations based on statistical designs that have adequate power, account for inter-individual variation, and include controls and shams, (2) studies that transcend the laboratory and the field with more studies in marine waters, (3) incorporation of knowledge and techniques emerging from the medical and veterinary disciplines, (4) addressing all components of the surgical event, (5) comparative studies that evaluate the same surgical techniques on multiple species and in different environments, (6) consideration of how biotic factors (e.g., sex, age, size) influence tagging outcomes, and (7) studies that cover a range of endpoints over ecologically relevant time periods},

	abstract = {The common thresher shark (Alopias vulpinus) is the focus of a popular southern California recreational fishery that typically captures individuals by hooking them in the caudal fin. This technique reduces the ability for forward locomotion and the capacity for ram ventilation. This study assessed the post-capture survivorship of tail-hooked adult and sub-adult common thresher sharks using pop-up satellite archival tags (PSATs) and quantified physiological indicators of capture stress in the blood. Survival of the acute effects of capture was determined from the depth and temperature records of 10-day PSAT deployments. Survivorship estimates were based on 19 common thresher sharks [160-221�cm fork length (FL);  ̃67-151�kg] captured in southern California from 2007 to 2009 using recreational stand-up tackle (36�kg). Five mortalities were observed over the course of the study resulting in an overall post-release mortality estimate of 26\%. All mortalities occurred in large individuals ({\textgreater}=180�cm FL) with fight times {\textgreater}=85�min. The archived depth and temperature data from surviving sharks resembled those of previous common thresher movement studies with a diel depth distribution predominantly within the uniformed temperature surface layer. Capture induced stress parameters measured from the blood of eight additional common thresher sharks that were not tagged revealed plasma lactate and hematocrit levels that were significantly elevated with increased fight time. Similarly, all thresher sharks showed heightened heat shock protein 70 (hsp 70) values relative to those obtained from blood that was allowed to recover in vitro for 24�h. Collectively, our findings indicate that large tail-hooked common thresher sharks with prolonged fight times ({\textgreater}=85�min) exhibit a heightened stress response which may contribute to an increased mortality rate. These results suggest that for larger individuals the current caudal-based capture methods used in the California recreational fishery may not be suitable for an effective catch-and-release based conservation strategy},

The demography for \textit{Carcharias taurus}, with a 2-year reproductive cycle, produced higher potential population growth using actual fertility rather than effective annual fertility. The demography for \textit{Alopias pelagicus}, with continuous reproduction, produced higher potential population growth for a birth-flow than a birth-pulse population. The \textit{Carcharodon carcharias} example demonstrated only a small difference in potential population growth between step-like and logistic fertility functions. Stage-based models with fixed stage duration produced potential population growths identical to those obtained from a life-history table or Leslie matrix, but the net reproductive rates and generation times differed. Stage-based models with few stages had different dynamics with shorter recovery to the stable age distribution; they underestimated the elasticity of juvenile survival and overestimated the elasticity of adult survival, suggesting that interpretation should be cautious. Elasticity analyses were used to estimate the number of juvenile age classes that could be fished and have the same effect on potential population growth as fishing all the adult age classes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The paper reviews the concept of sustainable development (\&\#8216;sustainability\&\#8217;). Five sustainability frameworks are suggested for developing and grouping indicators. A discussion of the criteria that could be used to measure and monitor progress towards sustainability includes the types of possible indicators, their use within the sustainability concept, use of reference points on which to compare indicators and their relation to planning and management. Sustainable Development Reference Systems are introduced as a tool for grouping indicators and representing the interrelationships among them. Visual methods of portraying the human and environmental dimensions of sustainability and their indicators can be broadened to permit temporal and spatial comparisons. These, combined with systems to scale the different dimensions to reflect different societal values of their importance, can assist policy makers, fisheries managers, industries, non-governmental organizations and the general public in understanding and assessing progress towards sustainable development of capture fisheries.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Archival tags were used to study the movement and depth behaviour of school sharks, Galeorhinus galeus, in southern australia. Thirty fish were tagged in late 1997, and to date there have been nine recaptures (30\% recapture rate). Periods at liberty varied from 8 days to 18 months. The sharks spent about 80\% of their time on the continental shelf, and appeared to swim close to the bottom during the day. At night they often ascended for periods of up to several hours, except at times around the full moon. When in deep water, the sharks typically descended at dawn to depths of up to 600?m, before ascending at dusk. It was not possible to use the light data from the tags to estimate position when the sharks were in deep water, because they were often at depths beyond the sensitivity of the tag. In shallower water, longitude was estimated from the light data but latitude was estimated from the maximum daily depth, assuming the fish were on the bottom. The timing of the dives in deepwater appeared sufficiently regular to offer the prospect of using it to estimate longitude. We propose future research using archival tags on this species should address questions about female reproductive migrations, pelagic behaviour and vertical movements},

	abstract = {We developed a new approach for evaluating gillnet catches. A model of a gillnet catch was built to differentiate the effects of gillnet saturation, fish activity and fish escapement from the gillnet catch. The corrected gillnet catch, termed the catchable biomass rate in the text, is the weight of fish that can be caught within an hour by an empty gillnet during a period of unitary fish activity. We also observed the effects of soak time (2, 5, 8, 11 and 13�h) and sampling period (August vs. September) on the catch. Our results show that saturation and fish escapement from gillnets are important events occurring during each use, thus violating the assumption of a linear relationship between gillnet catch and fish density. The maximal capacity of a standardized benthic gillnet (45�m2 area, 12 mesh sizes that range from 5 to 55�mm) was assessed to be 11�kg, i.e., 245�kg 1000�m-2 of gillnet. Sampling time had only a negligible effect on the gillnet catch. We recommend using the catchable biomass rate instead of uncorrected gillnet catches in interpretation of obtained data, especially when the catches are above 3�kg per standardized gillnet (i.e., 67�kg 1000�m-2). We created a conversion table and a slide rule, from which the catchable biomass rates can be determined. We also developed a method for the conversion of catches based on different soak times. Our findings help to better understand the processes underlying gillnet catches and improve the interpretability and reliability of this method in comparing different gears used and assessing fish communities in general},

	abstract = {The common blacktip shark (Carcharhinus limbatus) and the Australian blacktip shark (C. tilstoni) are morphologically similar species that co-occur in subtropical and tropical Australia. In striking contrast to what has been previously reported, we demonstrate that the common blacktip shark is not rare in northern Australia but occurs in approximately equal frequencies with the Australian blacktip shark. Management of shark resources in northern Australia needs to take account of this new information. Species identification was performed using nucleotide sequences of the control, NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 (ND4) and cytochrome oxidase I (COI) regions in the mitochondrial genome. The proportion of overall genetic variation (FST) between the two species was small (0.042, P {\textless} 0.01) based on allele frequencies at five microsatellite loci. We confirm that a third blacktip species (C. amblyrhynchoides, graceful shark) is closely related to C. tilstoni and C. limbatus and can be distinguished from them on the basis of mtDNA sequences from two gene regions. The Australian blacktip shark (C. tilstoni) was not encountered among 20 samples from central Indonesia that were later confirmed to be common blacktip and graceful sharks. Fisheries regulators urgently need new information on life history, population structure and morphological characters for species identification of blacktip shark species in Australia},

	abstract = {Size measurements are crucial for studies on the growth, maturation, maximum size, and population structure of cartilaginous fishes. However, researchers use a variety of measurement techniques even when working on the same species. Accurate comparison of results among studies is only possible if the measurement technique used is adequately defined and, if different techniques are used, a conversion equation can be derived. These conditions have not always been met, leading to invalid comparisons and incorrect conclusions. This paper reviews methods used for measuring chondrichthyans, and summarises the variety of constraints that influence the choice of a measurement technique. Estimates of the variability present in some measurement techniques are derived for shortfin mako shark, Isurus oxyrinchus , porbeagle shark, Lamna nasus , blue shark, Prionace glauca , Antarctic thorny skate, Amblyraja georgiana , and Pacific electric ray, Torpedo californica . Total length measured with the tail in the natural position (sharks) and disc widths (batoids) have higher variability than other methods, and are not recommended. Instead, the longest longitudinal axis should be measured where possible and practical; i.e., flexed total length for sharks, total length for batoids (excluding suborder Myliobatoidei), pelvic length for batoids of the suborder Myliobatoidei, and chimaera length (snout to posterior end of supracaudal fin) for chimaeroids (except for Callorhinchus , for which fork length should be measured from the anterior edge of the snout protuberance). Straight-line measurements are preferred to measurements over the curve of the body. Importantly, measurement methods must be clearly defined, giving information on the anterior reference point, the posterior reference point, and how the measurement was made between these two. Measurements using at least two different methods are recommended on at least a subsample of the fish in order to develop conversion regression relationships},

	abstract = {An elasmobranch survey of sub-tropical Hervey Bay, Australia, captured the slit-eye shark Loxodon macrorhinus at only one of three sites sampled. The dietary composition of this small shark species was compared to the prey communities within Hervey Bay to test whether prey availability was driving this observation. Dietary analysis of prey groups revealed that teleosts dominated the diet, per cent index of relative importance, \% IRI (79-+5\%) and per cent geometric index of importance, \% GII (52-+7\%), with shrimp-like invertebrates and cephalopods identified as the most important invertebrate prey groups. Baited remote underwater video (BRUV) used to sample prey communities at each site, demonstrated a highly diverse and significantly different community composition among the sites. There was no significant overlap between the diet of L. macrorhinus and any of the prey communities detected by BRUVs according to one-way analysis of similarities and the simplified Morisita index. Habitat electivity analysis revealed affinity of L. macrorhinus for the site with the highest water clarity (Secchi disc depth), opposing that of three other shark species. Overall, the results suggest that the distribution of L. macrorhinus is not driven by prey availability but other factors such as water clarity, predator avoidance or a reduction in interspecies competition},

The method, called Depletion-Based Stock Reduction Analysis (DB-SRA), merges stochastic Stock-Reduction Analysis with Depletion-Corrected Average Catch. Data requirements include estimates of historical annual catches, approximate natural mortality rate and age at maturity. A production function is specified based on general fishery knowledge of the relative location of maximum productivity and the relationship of MSY fishing rate to the natural mortality rate. This leaves unfished biomass as the only unknown parameter, which can be estimated given a designated relative depletion level near the end of the time series. The method produces probability distributions of management reference points concerning yield and biomass. Uncertainties in natural mortality, stock dynamics, optimal harvest rates, and recent stock status are incorporated using Monte Carlo exploration. Comparison of model outputs to data-rich stock assessments suggests that the method is effective for estimating sustainable yields for data-poor stocks},

Georgia is one of few US states without a directed commercial shark fishery, but the state has a large, nearshore penaeid shrimp trawl fishery in which small sharks occur as bycatch. During our 1995-1998 investigation of bycatch in fishery-dependent sampling events, 34\% of 127 trawls contained sharks. This bycatch totalled 217 individuals from six species, with Atlantic sharpnose shark, Rhizoprionodon terraenovae (Richardson), the most common and finetooth shark, Carcharhinus isodon (M++ller \& Henle) and spinner shark, Carcharhinus brevipinna (M++ller \& Henle), the least common. The highest catch rates for sharks occurred during June and July and coincided with the peak months of the pupping season for many species. Trawl tow speed and tow time did not significantly influence catch rates for shark species. Gear configurations [net type, turtle excluder device (TED), bycatch reduction device] affected catch rates for shark species. Results of this study indicate gear restrictions, a delayed season opening, or reduced bar spacing on TEDs may reduce shark bycatch in this fishery},

	abstract = {Demographic analyses are used to assess the status and vulnerability of elasmobranchs but their accuracy is often affected by limited basic biological information. Although the Port Jackson shark Heterodontus portusjacksoni (Meyer) is currently not considered at threat, there is insufficient data for eastern Australia to assess this rigorously. The present study determined vital demographic rates of adult and juvenile H. portusjacksoni at four locations on the central and southern coast of New South Wales, Australia from January 2002 to December 2005 using underwater visual census, tag–recapture and samples obtained from a commercial fishery. Natural mortality was low in adults (0.063–0.074 year–1) and juveniles (0.225 year–1), but substantial at the embryonic stage (0.783–0.896 year–1). Adult growth rates (31.4–32.7 mm year–1) were slightly less than that of juveniles (36.8–37.5 mm year–1). Males at both stages grew slightly faster than females. However, H. portusjacksoni had slower growth rates than many other elasmobranch species. Having a low intrinsic rate of increase (r = 0.069 year–1), long generation times (++1 = 22.5 year) and a low rebound potential, adults are the stage with the greatest impact on population growth. Hence, their life history strategy makes them susceptible to serious decline under exploitation, and management should strive to maintain the adult reproductive stock as a priority},

A total of 539 sharks were collected during the study: 207 in north-west Florida (latitude  ̃30-�N), 176 in Tampa Bay ( ̃28-�N) and 156 in Florida Bay ( ̃25-�N). Male and female bonnetheads in north-west Florida had the largest predicted asymptotic sizes (1007-�mm and 1398-�mm TL, respectively) and attained the largest estimated median size at maturity (830-�mm and 944-�mm, respectively) and the oldest estimated median age at maturity (3.0+-�years and 4.0+-�years, respectively). The largest near-term embryos (297-�mm TL) were also collected at the highest latitude, but no latitudinal difference in litter size was found. These differences in life-history traits provide supporting evidence that a pattern of latitudinal variation exists. Male and female bonnetheads in north-west Florida also had the fastest growth rate compared with the other locations, supporting the hypothesis that growth rate is inversely related to the length of the growing season (i.e. a pattern of countergradient variation exists).},

The majority of the identified catch was comprised of grey reef (62-72\%), whitetip reef (16-29\%) and blacktip reef (6-13\%) sharks. Logbook data revealed spatially and temporally variable landings of shark from the GBR. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) through time was stable for the period from 1989 to 2006 with no evidence of increase or decline. Data from observer and ELF data sets indicated no differences in CPUE among regions. The ELF data set demonstrated that CPUE was higher in Marine National Park zones (no fishing) when compared to General Use zones (open to fishing). The ongoing and consistent catches of reef sharks in the fishery and effectiveness of no-fishing zones suggest that management zones within the GBR Marine Park are effective at protecting a portion of the reef shark population from exploitation},

	abstract = {This is the first study to analyse the structure and biological characteristics of Squalus megalops and the impact of fishing on its population in the Northern Hemisphere (central-east Atlantic). The sex ratio (1:2.59) diverged significantly from 1:1 in favour of females. The length at maturity for males and females was 490 and between 634 and 659�mm total length, respectively. The lengths at pregnancy and maternity were 661 and 681�mm, respectively. S. megalops is an asynchronous breeder in which ovulation, parturition and pregnancy do not take place at a specific time of year. The maximum litter size was six, and the ovulation-gestation period was two years, which is equal to a maximum productivity of 36 offspring per lifetime. The sex ratio of near-term embryos (1:1.15) did not show any significant differences. The mean growth rate of the embryos was 179�mm/year in the first year and 47�mm/year in the second, indicating a period of gestation of two years. Age estimates ranged between 4 and 26 years for males and 4 and 32 years for females. Males and females of all total lengths were found in the same area and bathymetric strata in different seasons of the year. The estimate of total mortality for females was 0.22�year-1 and 0.19�year-1 for males. Natural mortality was 0.107�years-1 and 0.12�years-1 for females and males, respectively. The values for fishing mortality and the exploitation ratio were 0.113�years-1 and 0.51 for females and 0.07�years-1 and 0.38 for males, respectively. The estimated biological parameters indicate that S. megalops is highly susceptible to overfishing, given the high fishing pressure this species experiences in the central-east Atlantic},

Five sharks visited Cocos Island, 627 km distant from Malpelo. One of the sharks that appeared at Cocos Island also visited the Galapagos Islands, 710 km from Cocos, a month later. There is connectivity of Sphyrna lewini between Malpelo, Cocos and the Galapagos Islands, but the frequency of movements between the islands appears to be relatively low (\&lt;7\% of the tagged sharks). The most common depth at which the sharks swam coincided with the thermocline (rs = 0.72, p \&lt; 0.01). The depth of the thermocline varied depending on the time of the year. Nocturnal detections of the sharks were more frequent during the cold season than during the warm season (W = 60, p \&lt; 0.01).

	abstract = {Summary * 1Precise estimates of demographic rates are key components of population models used to predict the effects of stochastic environmental processes, harvest scenarios and extinction probability. * 2We used a 12-year photographic identification library of whale sharks from Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia to construct Cormack–Jolly–Seber (CJS) model estimates of survival within a capture–mark–recapture (CMR) framework. Estimated survival rates, population structure and assumptions regarding age at maturity, longevity and reproduction frequency were combined in a series of age-classified Leslie matrices to infer the potential trajectory of the population. * 3Using data from 111 individuals, there was evidence for time variation in apparent survival (-�) and recapture probability (p). The null model gave a @ of 0-+825 (95\% CI: 0-+727–0-+893) and p݂-�=-�0-+184 (95\% CI: 0-+121–0-+271). The model-averaged annual @ ranged from 0-+737 to 0-+890. There was little evidence for a sex effect on survival. * 4Using standardized total length as a covariate in the CMR models indicated a size bias in -�. Ignoring the effects of time, a 5-m shark has a @-�=-�0-+59 and a 9-�m shark has @-�=-�0-+81. * 5Of the 16 model combinations considered, 10 (63\%) indicated a decreasing population (++-�{\textless}-�1). For models based on age at first reproduction (+�) of 13-�years, the mean age of reproducing females at the stable age distribution (-�) ranged from 15 to 23-�years, which increased to 29–37-�years when +� was assumed to be 25. * 6All model scenarios had higher total elasticities for non-reproductive female survival [E(snr)] compared to those for reproductive female survival [E(sr)]. * 7Assuming relatively slow, but biologically realistic, vital rates (+�-�=-�25 and biennial reproduction) and size-biased survival probabilities, our results suggest that the Ningaloo Reef population of whale sharks is declining, although more reproductive data are clearly needed to confirm this conclusion. Combining relatively precise survival estimates from CMR studies with realistic assumptions of other vital rates provides a useful heuristic framework for determining the vulnerability of large oceanic predators for which few direct data exist},

	abstract = {Current lightbased geolocation techniques used to identify migration routes of highly mobile species have inherent limitations, depending on the type of tag technologies used. Recovered data storage tags provide detailed time series of light-levels suited for extensive post-processing, while pop-up satellite tags (PSATs) are bandwidth-limited and generally provide samples only at critical times of the day. An alternative approach is to detect a sunrise or sunset event and transmit only this information, thus freeing bandwidth for depth or temperature data. We show here that this geolocation technique retains the essential information to correct for known problems such as errors at the equinoxes. We describe the suitable model for such data, as well as the behavior of resulting location error and bias in simulated cases. Illustrations from PSAT tags at the ocean’s surface and on a freely-swimming fish reveal a highly non-Gaussian error distribution. To solve for this, we present a more generalized estimation framework than linear Gaussian models, based on an extension of the Kalman filter. We apply iterative nonlinear Least squares to address non-Gaussian errors, non-linear dynamics and missing data. The proposed optimization method may include coastlines or bathymetric limits as hard constraints. Our results indicate that sunrise/sunset-based geolocation is a viable technique technique to surmount tag design or engineering limitations when tracking pelagic fish},

Corroborating evidence for age and growth estimates was obtained from length-frequency distributions and tag-recapture data. To aid validation of these estimates, tetracycline was injected into sharks at the time of tagging. Growth is relatively rapid in the first year of life: vertebral ageing indicated 17 cm growth in total length (TL) for C. tilstoni and about 20 cm for C. sorrah during the first year after birth. By the time the sharks are 5 years old, growth has declined to 8-10 cm per year in C. tilsoni and 5 cm per year or less in C. sorrah. The von Bertalanffy growth parameters for C. tilstoni are L∞ = 194.2, K = 0.14, t0 = -2.8 for females, and L∞ = 165.4, K = 0.19, t0 = -2.6 for males; for C. sorrah the parameters are L∞ = 123.9, K = 0.34, t0 = -1.9 for females, and L∞ = 98.4, K = 1.17, t0 = -0.6 for males.

	abstract = {1. Life-history theory predicts that organisms will provide an optimal level of parental investment for offspring survival balanced against the effects on their own survival and future reproductive potential. 2. Optimal resource allocation models also predict an increase in reproductive output with age as expected future reproductive effort decreases. To date, maternal investment in sharks has received limited attention. 3. We found that neonatal dusky sharks (Carcharhinus obscurus) are not independent from maternal resource allocation at the point of parturition but instead are provisioned with energy reserves in the form of an enlarged liver that constitutes approximately 20\% of total body mass. 4. Analysis of long-term archived data sets showed that a large proportion of this enlarged liver is utilized during the first weeks or months of life suggesting that the reported weight loss of newborn sharks signifies a natural orientation process and is not necessarily related to prey abundance and/or indicative of high mortality rates. 5. Interrogation of near-term pup mass in two carcharhinids, the dusky and spinner shark (Carcharhinus brevipinna), further revealed an increase in reproductive output with maternal size, with evidence for a moderate decline in the largest mothers. 6. For the dusky shark, there was a trade-off between increasing litter size and near-term pup mass in support of optimal offspring size theory. 7. For both the dusky and spinner shark, there was a linear increase in near-term pup mass with month, which may indicate variable parturition strategies and/or that carcharhinids are able to adjust the length of the gestation period. 8. The identification of optimal size-specific reproductive output has direct implications for improving the reproductive potential of exploited shark populations and for structuring future management strategies},

	abstract = {Dramatic declines in populations of large elasmobranchs, as well as the potential release of elasmobranch mesopredators, have led to interest in the ecological role of this group of fishes. The first step to elucidating their ecological importance, however, is an understanding of elasmobranch community structure. Such studies are relatively uncommon, especially in communities where human impacts are thought to be low. We used visual surveys and a variety of capture methods to determine spatial and temporal variation in the species composition of a sandflat elasmobranch community in the relatively pristine ecosystem of Shark Bay, Australia. Overall, juvenile batoids dominated the community. Eleven elasmobranch species (10 batoids, 1 shark) were found to inhabit the sandflats during the cold season (June–August) and 21 species (12 batoids, 9 sharks) were recorded during the warm season. The overall density of elasmobranchs occupying the sandflat was also higher during the warm season. Nearshore areas, especially during the warm season, supported the highest densities of elasmobranchs overall as well as the dominant species (giant shovelnose ray, Glaucostegus typus , and reticulate whipray, Himantura uarnak ). Such high elasmobranch abundance may be driven by a combination of factors including prey availability, predator avoidance, and behavioral thermoregulation. The high species richness and density of elasmobranchs in such a restricted area suggest that elasmobranch mesopredators could exert strong top-down impacts in nearshore environments in the absence of human impacts, but raises questions of how resources are partitioned among apparently similar species in this system},

There are morphology-based identification problems among and within genera, and landings of processed shark products further prevent an objective assessment of these species. The present study is the first attempt to test the suitability of using a DNA barcode approach to discriminate accurately among the four most important commercial deep-water shark species: Centrophorus squamosus, Centrophorus granulosus, Centroscymnus coelolepis and, recently discovered in Portuguese ports, Centroscymnus owstoni. Sequence analyses of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene revealed low levels of haplotypic and genetic diversities. Higher levels of inter-specific relative to intra-specific divergences allowed discrimination among species, which form reciprocally monophyletic clades. Inclusion of published COI sequences from other species within the same genera revealed haplotype sharing among species, which calls into question the current taxonomy and accuracy of fisheries data available. Amplification of the COI gene coupled with MboI restriction digests was found to be a fast and inexpensive strategy to resolve within genera identification problems. Molecular barcoding constitutes a critical tool for the assessment and implementation of urgent management policies for this group of species},

In each region females attain a larger size than males, and collectively those sharks in western Victoria are smaller, present higher mass-at-length, and lower length-at-maturity than those in far-eastern Victoria. These regional differences might be a result of sampling bias, length-selective fishing mortality, environmental conditions, or genetic differences. However, tagging evidence from previous studies and the presence of two bio-geographic provinces in the region support the hypothesis of two separate breeding populations. The essential reproductive parameters for H. portusjacksoni population analysis in far-eastern Victoria were determined, using a novel method to estimate fecundity and the ovarian cycle of an egg-laying species. In this region, females have between 6 and 20 pre-ovulatory oocytes (average = 14, n = 29, standard deviation = 3.71) before the reproductive season. The species has an annual reproductive cycle correlated with water temperature, with ovulation starting during late winter to early spring and a  ̃6 month egg-laying period. The period from the onset of vitellogenesis to ovulation of oocytes is  ̃18 months},

Photo-identification techniques were used to investigate the frequency of hooking at 25 aggregation sites along the east coast of Australia between 2006 and 2008. Of the 673 sharks identified, 113 sharks were identified with signs of 119 incidences of hooking. For sharks with both their left and right flank photographed during a single survey day, up to 29\% of females and 52\% of males were identified with retained fishing gear or an attributed jaw injury. The largest number of sharks identified (222) were from a year-round aggregation of immature and mature sharks at Fish Rock, New South Wales, Australia. Forty-eight per cent of all sharks identified with retained fishing gear were first identified at this site. Fish Rock, a designated critical habitat for C. taurus, allows most forms of line fishing except fishing with bait or wire trace while anchored or moored. As interactions with fishing gear can result in debilitating disease, morbidity and death, the high incidence of hooked individual C. taurus is considered a key threatening process that is likely to reduce this shark population’s ability to recover},

	abstract = {The rate of growth of any population is a quantity of interest in conservation and management and is constrained by biological factors. In this study, recent data on life-history parameters influencing rates of population growth in humpback whales, including survival, age at first parturition and calving rate are reviewed. Monte Carlo simulations are used to compute a distribution of rates of increase (ROIs) taking into account uncertainty in biological parameter estimates. Two approaches for computing juvenile survival are proposed, which taken into account along with other life-history data, resulted in the following estimates of the rate of population growth: Approach A: mean of 7.3\%/year (95\% CI = 3.5–10.5\%/year) and Approach B: mean of 8.6\%/year (95\% CI = 5.0–11.4\%/year). It is proposed that the upper 99\% quantile of the resulting distribution of the ROI for Approach B (11.8\%/year) be established as the maximum plausible ROI for humpback whales and be used in population assessment of the species. Possible sources of positive and negative biases in the present estimates are presented and include measurement error in estimation of life-history parameters, changes in the environment within the period these quantities are measured, density dependence or other natural factors. However, it is difficult to evaluate potential biases without additional data. The methods presented in this study can be applied to other species for which life-history parameters are available and are useful in assessing plausibility in the estimation of population growth rates from time series of abundance estimates},

DCAC and DB-SRA are fairly robust to mis-specification of the distributions for natural mortality and the productivity parameter (the fishing mortality rate that corresponds to maximum sustainable yield relative to natural mortality) for the flatfish life-history, but led to greater error for the rockfish life-history when estimating harvest levels that would not result in overfishing. SS estimates of the harvest level increased when natural mortality was set to a higher value than the true value for both life-histories. Both DCAC and DB-SRA were highly sensitive to the assumed distribution for the ratio of the current to starting biomass and provided overestimates of the harvest level when based on an overly optimistic value for this ratio},

	abstract = {This paper describes a computer model designed to simulate longline catch\&\#8211;effort data, and to test the robustness of methods to standardize the relative catch per unit effort (CPUE) abundance index. The model considers abundance and catch by month, area and depth based on the temperature habitat of the species. Characteristics of fishing gears are used in a submodel to predict catch rate by set and depth. An application to an Atlantic blue marlin bycatch fishery from 1956 to 1999 is presented. The depth distributions of sets, the propensity of marlin to bite stationary moving baits, and the assumed habitat preferences were each varied. The simulated CPUE series were standardized using both habitat-based and General Linear Models (GLM). Unstandardized CPUE trends were strongly biased. The GLM standardizations accurately reflected trends in the simulated population. The habitat standardizations proved accurate when the assumptions used in the analysis were precisely correct, but were often strongly biased when the assumptions were inaccurate. These results suggest that habitat standardization of CPUE time series is potentially useful if there is accurate knowledge of the distributions of the population, the actual fishing depths of the gears and factors that may affect the fish\&\#39;s propensity to take bait. Absent certain knowledge of these factors, the habitat approach to standardization should be used with great caution.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The extra information on SST is included in a consistent manner within the milieu of the Kalman filter. The technique was evaluated by attaching PSATs directly on thermistor-equipped global positioning system drifter buoys. SSTs measured in the PSATs and drifter buoy were statistically compared with SSTs determined from satellites. The method is applied to two tracks derived from PSAT-tagged blue sharks (Prionace glauca) in the central Pacific Ocean. The inclusion of SST in the model produced substantially more probable tracks with lower prediction variance than those estimated from light-level data alone},

The vessel fleet has gradually upgraded characteristics such as engine power and use of propeller nozzles, quad nets, global positioning systems (GPS) and computer mapping software. These changes, together with the ever-changing profile of the fleet, were analysed by linear mixed models to quantify annual efficiency increases of an average vessel at catching prawns or scallops. The analyses included vessel characteristics (treated as fixed effects) and vessel identifier codes (treated as random effects). For the period from 1989 to 2004 the models estimated overall fishing power increases of 6\% in the northern tiger, 6\% in the northern endeavour, 12\% in the southern tiger, 18\% in the red spot king, 46\% in the eastern king prawn and 15\% in the saucer scallop sector.

The northeastern Pacific is the home range for a genetically distinct clade of white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias). Little is known about the conservation status of this demographically isolated population, concentrated seasonally at two discrete aggregation sites: Central California (CCA) and Guadalupe Island, Mexico. We used photo-identification of dorsal fins in a sequential Bayesian mark–recapture algorithm to estimate white shark abundance off CCA. We collected 321 photographs identifying 130 unique individuals, and estimated the abundance off CCA to be 219 mature and sub-adult individuals ((130, 275) 95\% credible intervals), substantially smaller than populations of other large marine predators. Our methods can be readily expanded to estimate shark population abundance at other locations, and over time, to monitor the status, population trends and protection needs of these globally distributed predators},

	abstract = {Standardization of commercial catch and effort data is important in fisheries where standardized abundance indices based on fishery-dependent data are a fundamental input to stock assessments. The goal of the standardization is then to minimize bias due to the confounding of apparent abundance patterns with fishing power. There is a high risk of confounding between fishing power and abundance in fisheries where the fleet has altered their fishing technology over the years. Also, the spatial aspects and the fishing history can be so heterogeneous that any standardization really involves an extrapolation, for example to a hypothetical standard vessel. When the standardization involves an extrapolation, then the appropriate modeling strategy is to build a so-called estimation model, rather than a predictive model. Strategies to build such an estimation model from fishery-dependent data include: pay careful attention to subject matter, and collect information about potential confounding effects to include in the model (putting a high value on the acquisition of data on covariates); model variable catchability at a highly disaggregated scale; aim for realistic coefficients when fitting the model and pay relatively less attention to achieving precision or maximizing explained variance; adopt modern statistical methods to combine data from different sources; and if data are deficient, then apply precautionary allowances. These strategies offer some protection against bias due to confounding, in the absence of formal criteria for identifying the best model},

Year, latitude, and the catch-rate of yellowfin explained the most of the deviance (32-49\%, depending on model configuration) and were identified consistently among methods, while trends in standardized catch-rate differed spatially. However, the trends in standardized catch-rates by area were found to be relatively insensitive to the approach used for standardization, including whether the catch-rates of yellowfin and albacore were included in the analyses},

However, there is a challenge associated with the application of MPAs in marine resource management with respect to the consequences to traditional systems of monitoring and managing fisheries resources. The place-based paradigm of MPAs can complicate the population-based paradigm of most fisheries stock assessments. In this review, we identify the potential complications that could result from both existing and future MPAs to the science and management systems currently in place for meeting conventional fisheries management objectives. The intent is not to evaluate the effects of implementing MPAs on fisheries yields, or even to consider the extent to which MPAs may achieve conservation oriented objectives, but rather to evaluate the consequences of MPA implementation on the ability to monitor and assess fishery resources consistent with existing methods and legislative mandates. Although examples are drawn primarily from groundfish fisheries on the West Coast of the USA, the lessons are broadly applicable to management systems worldwide, particularly those in which there exists the institutional infrastructure for managing resources based on quantitative assessments of resource status and productivity},

	abstract = {A review of past behavioral ultrasonic telemetry studies of sharks and rays is presented together with previously unpublished material on the behavior of the lemon shark, Negaprion brevirostris, around the Bimini Islands, Bahamas. The review, focusing on movement behaviors of 20 shark and three ray species, reveals that elasmobranchs exhibit a variety of temporal and spatial patterns in terms of rates-of-movement and vertical as well as horizontal migrations. The lack of an apparent pattern in a few species is probably attributable to the scarcity of tracking data. Movements are probably governed by several factors, some still not studied, but data show that food, water temperature, bottom type, and magnetic gradient play major roles in a shark's decision of where and when to swim. A few species exhibit differences in behavior between groups of sharks within the same geographical area. This interesting finding warrants further research to evaluate the causes of these apparent differences and whether these groups constitute different subpopulations of the same species. The lack of telemetry data on batoids and some orders of sharks must be addressed before we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the behavior of elasmobranch fishes. Previously unpublished data from 47 smaller and 38 larger juvenile lemon sharks, collected over the decade 1988–1998, provide new results on movement patterns, habitat selection, activity rhythms, swimming speed, rate-of-movement, and homing behavior. From these results we conclude that the lemon shark is an active predator with a strong, apparently innate homing mechanism. This species shows ontogenetic differences in habitat selection and behavior, as well as differences in movements between groups of individuals within the same area. We suggest three hypotheses for future research on related topics that will help to understand the enigmatic behavior of sharks},

The Indian Ocean longline fisheries are taken as an example. This paper evaluates the potential bias in the relationship between local CPUE and abundance when fisheries are increasing their fishing effort. A presentation of the Indian Ocean longline fisheries is carried out. A statistical analysis of CPUE is conducted using a generalized additive model which tends to indicate that the local effort is an important component in the statistical behaviour of the local CPUE. A migratory model in which both resources and fisheries are mobile was built. This model simulates the combined exploitation of two species, a target and a bycatch species, both fished at increasing intensity. This model confirms the potential bias as a result of the concentration of fishing effort in areas of high density of the target species. It also suggests that the CPUE of bycatch species may be more heavily biased because of their status. It is recommended that local fishing efforts should preferably be taken into account in order to calculate the CPUE of both target and non-target species.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Two sets of data were available from the experiments carried out during two distinct periods: 1990-1991 and 1993-1995. The results of the analysis were compared with the previous analyses and discussed in relation to management of skipjack fisheries in the Maldives and in the Indian Ocean. The movements were found to be highly variable in space and time, and few consistent patterns were observed between the two data sets. Similarly, significantly different estimates of fishing and natural mortality rates were observed from the two data sets. These differences were found, in part, to be due to the uneven distribution of tag releases in both space and time. Estimates of movement and attrition rates show that emigration from the Maldivian fishery to the rest of the Indian Ocean's was small. The exploitation rate was found to be substantial, contributing about 30-40\% of the total attrition in the fishery area. Such levels of localized exploitation may be maintained by steady immigration from outside of the Maldives, but more extensive tagging is required to be certain. The impact of tuna fisheries elsewhere in the Indian Ocean on the domestic Maldivian fishery cannot be determined until a comprehensive large-scale tagging program, including all the fisheries in the Indian Ocean, is completed},

In response to improved methods between 1992 and 1995 the average yearly mortality fell to 0 humpback whales, 4 dugong, 3 loggerhead turtles (11 turtles in total), and 10 dolphin (species uncertain); this suggests no impact on whales, 0.1\% per year of the dugong population of the southern Great Barrier Reef, 1.6\% of the yearly indigenous harvest of green turtles in eastern Australia, and 0.2\% per year of the loggerhead turtle population in Queensland.

Although the reproductive biology of several species has been investigated, the reproductive physiology of only a few species has been reported. Only recently have the physiological factors of reproduction in cartilaginous fishes received attention. The information gained on reproductive cycles (both gonadal and uterine) has shown some similarities as well as differences between species. The serum levels of androgens, oestrogens, and progestins have been examined in several elasmobranch species and it has been shown that they are important in regulating key events in reproduction. The endocrine control of reproduction in elasmobranchs is more similar in many ways to higher vertebrates such as mammals than to teleosts. In general, the role of progesterone becomes more important than that of oestrogen in the transition from oviparity to viviparity. In addition, the roles of peptide hormones such as relaxin and the neurohypophysial hormones become increasingly important in viviparous species as in higher vertebrates. It is vital to understand the environmental and hormonal control of reproduction in elasmobranchs if more success is to be achieved in their reproduction in captivity. Knowledge gained from studies of the endocrine regulation of the reproductive cycle can be used to enhance the reproductive success of captive sharks, skates, and rays},

Age estimates were derived from 652 specimens (356 females and 296 males, 9.5-33.8�cm in disc width) using vertebral band counts and verified by length-frequency analysis of 1443 specimens (768 females, 675 males) collected between October 2004 and December 2007 in waters off northeastern Taiwan. The sexes-combined relationship between body weight (W) and disc width (DW) was W�=�0.0193�+�DW3.0144 (n�=�1399, p�{\textless}�0.05). Edge analysis indicated that a single growth band pair (comprising translucent and opaque bands) is formed each year, with up to 11 band pairs for females and 10 band pairs for males. The Robertson growth function had the best fit for both sexes and the growth parameters including 95\% confidence intervals were estimated as follows: asymptotic disc width (DW[infinity])�=�32.4 (31.3-34.0) cm DW, growth coefficient (k)�=�0.367 (0.315-0.426)�yr-1 for females; and DW[infinity]�=�28.8 (27.6-30.3)�cm DW, k�=�0.365 (0.311-0.424)�yr-1 for males. Age at maturity was estimated to be 7.2 and 6.8 yrs for females and males, respectively, while longevity was estimated to be 13.2 and 13.3 yrs, respectively. Length-frequency analysis produced similar results, supporting the vertebral aging estimates. Total mortality was estimated to be 0.85 and 0.86�yr-1, while natural mortality was 0.32 and 0.32�yr-1 for females and males, respectively. Our study indicates that it is likely that the sharpspine skate is at the margin of optimal exploitation and therefore close monitoring and seasonal closure management of trawl fishing are recommended to ensure sustainable utilization of this stock},

	abstract = {Abstract 10.1002/aqc.660.abs * 1.Over the past two decades the number of fisheries targeting shark resources has increased dramatically. A combination of factors, including relatively slow growth rate, low fecundity and late age of maturity, result in low recovery rates from exploitation for most shark species. This, in turn, is reflected in the poor record of sustainability of shark fisheries. * 2.One of the greatest challenges is to find a way to deal with the substantial levels of shark bycatch taken in many non-target fisheries. Poor general recording of shark landings and paucity of shark landing data at the species level also undermine the development of effective shark management strategies.3. This paper reviews the problems that must be faced worldwide if shark resources are to be managed sustainably and lays out a comprehensive set of prioritized management strategies to facilitate the sustainable management of global shark fisheries. It is acknowledged that the majority of sharks are harvested in developing countries and that the management of shark resources in developing and developed countries will need to incorporate different management strategies relevant to local socio-economic agendas. The management recommendations deal with methods to improve the global regulation of fisheries, ways to improve global conservation ethics and encourage active participation in management, as well as means by which specific management strategies may be implemented.

To address this, patterns of movement of 67 juvenile bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) were examined in the Caloosahatchee River between 2003 and 2006 using an array of 25 acoustic receivers. Individuals were monitored for periods of 1–460 days with most present for periods of weeks to months. Individuals utilised the entire monitored section of the river ( ̃27 km) and also moved upriver beyond the extent of the acoustic array. Daily activity spaces of individuals ranged from 0 to 14 km with most {\textless}5 km. Monthly mean home ranges were 0.9–5.6 km and although home-range sizes were consistent through time, location of individuals within the river changed through time. Individuals moved upstream during the day and downstream at night and this pattern persisted across years. Based on data collected from depth transmitters in 2006, individuals swam closer to the surface at night and remained in deeper water during the day, suggesting further diurnal patterns in habitat use. Long-term consistent use of this habitat by young C. leucas suggests this population is highly dependent on the Caloosahatchee River as a nursery area},

By studying the causes and consequences of individual movement, ecologists have gained greater insight into the behavior of individuals and the spatial dynamics of populations at increasingly higher levels of organization. In particular, ecologists have focused on the interaction between individuals and their environment in an effort to understand future impacts from habitat loss and climate change. Tools to examine this interaction have included: fractal analysis, first passage time, L+�vy flights, multi-behavioral analysis, hidden markov models, and state-space models. Concurrent with the development of movement models has been an increase in the sophistication and availability of hierarchical bayesian models. In this review we bring these two threads together by using hierarchical structures as a framework for reviewing individual models. We synthesize emerging themes in movement ecology, and propose a new hierarchical model for animal movement that builds on these emerging themes. This model moves away from traditional random walks, and instead focuses inference on how moving animals with complex behavior interact with their landscape and make choices about its suitability},

	abstract = {The pelagic thresher shark, Alopias pelagicus, like most large sharks produces a low number of offspring (two embryos per litter). However, there is no accurate information on its population status. To improve the accuracy of population simulations, a stochastic stage-based birth-flow model was constructed to assess the stock status of the pelagic thresher in the north-western Pacific. Based on the best biological information available, its life history was represented as four stages: neonates, juveniles, subadults, and adults. Results indicated that, without mortality from fishing, the stock would clearly increase (mean annual population growth rate (++)-�=-�1.058 year–1, 95\% CI-�=-�1.014–1.102 year–1). When current fishing mortality was taken into account, a decrease in population was indicated (++-�=-�0.979 year–1, 95\% CI-�= 0.921–1.030-�year–1) with a projected reduction of 34.3\% over 20 years. These results suggest that the stock is overexploited. Simulations using various management measures showed that the population will remain steady under these protection options. However, this species is extremely vulnerable to overexploitation and is especially sensitive at the juvenile and adult stages, implying that nursery closures or size limit management measures are urgently needed to ensure the sustainable utilisation of the stock},

A total of 24 active trackings (ranging from 2-�h to 103-�h in duration) were conducted. Patterns of rate of movement (ROM), swimming linearity (LI), swimming bearing, and instantaneous swimming speed (ISS) were assessed. A conversion quotient (Q) of 1.21 between ISS and ROM (10-�min sample interval) was calculated suggesting ROM is a good indicator of white shark activity. The mean ROM for tracked sharks was 0.52-�m-+s−1, with a greatest sustained ROM of 1.33-�m-+s−1 (4.8-�km-+h−1). Sharks displayed greatest LI and ROM during directional travels between the three persistent aggregation sites. The majority of the shark movement was, however, non-linear as the sharks repeat patrolled at the three aggregation sites. Two of these sites were not associated with pinniped presence, and sharks typically patrolled back and forth parallel to the shore line at a comparatively low ROM which suggested resting. The third aggregation site was adjacent to Seal Island, and despite low LI, sharks displayed a high ROM, indicating high activity levels. We propose that the high ROM is related to maximising search area when patrolling to hunt Cape fur seals (Arctocephalus p. pusillus)},

	abstract = {The survival of fish discarded after being caught can be improved by simple gear-based technical measures aimed at reducing discards. We look at the effects of three different codends on the initial health and short-term survival of trawl-caught skate (Rajidae), using a control codend (80�mm diamond mesh used as standard in the fishery) and two experimental codends (100�mm diamond mesh and 100�mm diamond mesh turned on the square). Both experimental nets reduced discarded numbers of fish by  ̃70\%, with no commercial loss. This reduction in discards had an effect in reducing the total weight of the experimental codends by as much as 80\%. We also placed 278 skate in onboard holding tanks for 48�h and evaluated the survival rates of fish caught in the different codends. Visual inspection of "health" at time zero was a good indicator of survival, because 86\% of skate with a good health score survived (p�{\textless}�0.01). From a further 1539 skate assessed for health, we show that fish caught in the control codend have the lowest proportional good health score (25\%), followed by the 100�mm diamond mesh codend (34\%) and the 100�mm square mesh codend (47\%). The health of the fish caught is related to codend weight (p�=�0.01). We conclude that technical measures aimed at reducing discards have an additional benefit; they indirectly increase discard survival, and the benefits of mitigating discards through by-catch reduction devices may be a more powerful tool in fisheries management than previously thought},

Marine protected areas (MPAs) have been proposed as an insurance policy against fishery management failures and as an integral part of an optimal management system for some fisheries. However, an incorrectly designed MPA can increase the risk of depletion of some species, and can reduce the value of the system of fisheries it impacts. MPAs may alter structural processes that relate fishery outcomes to management variables and thereby compromise the models that are used to guide decisions. New models and data gathering programs are needed to use MPAs effectively. This paper discusses the motivations and methods for incorporating explicitly spatial dynamics of both fish and fishermen into fishery models so that they can be used to assess spatial policies such as MPAs. Some important characteristics and capabilities which these models should have are outlined, and a topical review of some relevant modeling methodologies is provided},

	abstract = {The Scientific Committee on Ocean Research Panel on New Technologies for Observing Marine Life convened a workshop on geolocation methods in association with the Second International Symposium on Tagging and Tracking Marine Fish with Electronic Devices. This followed a previous workshop held in conjunction with the first symposium in Honolulu in 2000, which discussed the principles and some of the problems of estimating geolocation from underwater light measurements. The objectives of the 2007 workshop were to review advances made over the past decade in two key areas: estimation of position (using both light-based and other environmental based methods) and management and interpretation of position estimate data. The workshop also aimed to identify some of the key factors affecting the accuracy and precision of existing geolocation methods in estimating position. Consideration of the implications of uncertainties in track reconstruction for deductions about the behaviour and spatial dynamics of tagged animals was also included. This paper provides a summary of current research and technologies and the limitations of principal methods identified during the workshop. Recommendations for future development of methodology and technology included proposing a working group to better co-ordinate and consider analytical techniques and software needs. The workshop also recommended more dialogue between tag manufacturers and tag users to discuss technical issues, including sensor performance, availability of extra sensors, flexibility of tag programming, improved algorithms for light attenuation, and the compression and processing of data by tags prior to storage or transmission to satellite. Other recommendations included provision of an error field around each tag position determined by Service Argos, improved tools for visualisation of three-dimensional data and collection of an ‘ideal’ data set to be used for testing, comparing and developing geolocation techniques. In this context, the generation of an ideal dataset and the testing of techniques, better co-ordination and facilitation of data sharing and standardisation of quality control inputs were recommended. Finally, a widening of the dialogue between the archival tagging community and ecologists, resource managers and oceanographers was identified as a priority},

	abstract = {Fishery stock assessment models connect ecosystem data to quantitative fishery management. Control rules that calculate annual catch limits and targets from stock assessment results are a common component of US Fishery Management Plans. Ideally, the outcome of such control rules are updated annually on the basis of stock assessment forecasts to track fluctuations in stock abundance. When the stock assessment — fishery management enterprise achieves this level of throughput, they truly are operational models, much as the complex physical models used to routinely update climate forecasts. In reality, many contemporary assessments are closer to an individual scientific investigation than to an operational model. As a result, the review of each stock assessment is extensive and the lag between data acquisition and quota adjustment may extend to several years. If the future stock assessment process is to move towards an operational status, there will need to be changes in three aspects of the process. First, key data streams will themselves need to be made more operational and corporate so that relevant data are immediately available and trusted. Second, stock assessment models need to be made more capable of including diverse relevant data and comprehensively calculating levels of uncertainty, while also being more completely tested, documented, and standardized. The class of models called integrated analysis has these characteristics and is described here, with emphasis on the features of the Stock Synthesis model. Areas of future model development, especially to include more ecosystem and environmental factors, are explored. Third, increased throughput of assessment updates will require streamlining of the extensive review process now routinely required before stock assessment results can serve as the scientific basis for fishery management. Emphasizing review of broadly applicable assessment data and methods, rather than each final result, is a logical step in this streamlining, while maintaining public trust in the final results},

	abstract = {This paper develops a new method to objectively construct an area stratification for standardizing catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) with generalized linear models (GLMs). This algorithm incorporates the advantages of binary recursion as used in regression trees to minimize a chosen objective function, and extends the concept of stepwise model selection to minimize an appropriate goodness-of-fit criterion for a chosen statistical model, such as GLM. The algorithm can adaptively search for area stratifications that achieved better GLM fits to the CPUE data. The new algorithm, which we call [`]GLM-tree', is applied to swordfish CPUE data from Japanese longline vessels in the North Pacific as a case study. The GLM-tree algorithm was conducted with the fishery CPUE data under alternative assumptions about the structural complexity of the GLMs and alternative choices of goodness-of-fit criteria, e.g., Akaike or Bayesian information criteria. Results show that the GLM-tree algorithm created area stratifications more effectively than area stratification determined in an ad hoc manner, and made area stratifications with better fits to swordfish CPUE data until a goodness-of-fit criteria achieved minimum. The algorithm produced many alternative models under different model complexity and area stratifications, which could explain the swordfish CPUE data equally well, because the structural complexity of the GLMs can be compensated by increasing the number of areas. Effects of area stratifications on the estimates of standardized CPUE are also shown to indicate that estimates of the abundance indices tend to converge after a sufficient number of areas have been added},

Although organized game fishing began off eastern Australia in 1936, the majority of catches were made after 1960. Data normally recorded by these clubs included common name of shark, whole weight, locality of capture, boat name and angler. Recognized single species of sharks recorded by these clubs were blue ({\textless}I{\textgreater}Prionace glauca{\textless}/I{\textgreater}), tiger ({\textless}I{\textgreater}Galeocerdo cuvier{\textless}/I{\textgreater}), white ({\textless}I{\textgreater}Carcharodon carcharias{\textless}/I{\textgreater}), shortfin mako ({\textless}I{\textgreater}Isurus oxyrinchus{\textless}/I{\textgreater}) and grey nurse ({\textless}I{\textgreater}Carcharias taurus{\textless}/I{\textgreater}). Species identified only to generic level, and recorded by clubs, were whalers or requiem sharks ({\textless}I{\textgreater}Carcharhinus{\textless}/I{\textgreater} spp.), hammerheads ({\textless}I{\textgreater}Sphyrna{\textless}/I{\textgreater} spp.) and threshers ({\textless}I{\textgreater}Alopias{\textless}/I{\textgreater} spp.). Analysis of catch records indicated that the mako shark was the most common species caught overall, although whaler sharks dominated the catch in the northern part of the study area and hammerhead sharks dominated the catch in the south. Grey nurse and white sharks were relatively rare in the southern part of the study area. Whaler sharks dominated the catch in the 1960s, and the proportions of blue and tiger sharks in the catch increased in the 1980s. Size ranges and distributions of some species also varied through time and by area. Some of the observed changes could be attributed to changed fishing practices, particularly the increasing popularity of tag-and-release and an increasing tendency to fish further from the coast. A marked decline in the number and proportion of white sharks in the catch since the 1970s gives cause for some concern regarding the status of that species off south-eastern Australia.{\textless}/P{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Tiger sharks are important predators in the seagrass ecosystem of Shark Bay, Australia. Although sharks appear to return to a long-term study site within the Eastern Gulf periodically, the extent of their long-term movements is not known. Five sharks fitted with satellite transmitters showed variable movement patterns. Three sharks remained within the Shark Bay region and another made a 500-�km round-trip excursion to oceanic waters northwest of the bay. These four sharks showed relatively low displacement rates relative to sharks tracked over shorter time periods, suggesting that sharks move through large home ranges that include Shark Bay. Although no reliable position fixes were obtained for the fifth shark, we were able to use the timing of satellite uplinks and the position of the satellite to determine that it had moved at least 8,000-�km to the coastal waters of southeast Africa in 99-�days—the longest recorded movement by a tiger shark. This movement and previously documented trans-Atlantic movements suggest that tiger shark populations may mix across ocean basins and that tiger sharks are subject to anthropogenic effects at great distances from protected waters. Finally, our method for using single satellite uplinks may be useful in estimating movements for wide-ranging species that rarely provide high quality location estimates},

Von Bertalanffy growth parameters were estimated using three different techniques: vertebral ageing, back calculation and length frequency. Vertebrae from 138 specimens were sectioned and narrow circuli counted to estimate age. Marginal increment analysis verified that circuli were produced annually in late summer, probably as a result of stress during the mating season. The oldest female was 7 and male 6 years old. Von Bertalanffy growth parameters estimated from vertebral ageing data for males were tO = 0.410 yr, K = 1.337, L8 = 652.2 mm, and for females tO = 0.455 yr, K = 1.013 and L8 = 732.5 mm. Growth parameters determined by length frequency and back calculation techniques concurred with those from vertebral ageing. Growth of the 0+ age class was very rapid, averaging 140\% of the size at birth in the first year. Males and females matured after only one year, the lowest age at maturity reported in the family Carcharhinidae. Annual growth increments decreased rapidly after maturity, and little growth occurred after three years},

	abstract = {DNA barcoding – sequencing a region of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase 1 gene (cox1) – promises a rapid and accurate means of species identification, and of any life history stage. For sharks and rays, it may offer a ready means of identifying legal or illegal shark catches, including shark fins taken for the profitable shark fin market. Here it is shown that an analysis of sequence variability in a 655 bp region of cox1 from 945 specimens of 210 chondrichthyan species from 36 families permits the discrimination of 99.0\% of these species. Only the two stingarees Urolophus sufflavus and U. cruciatus could not be separated, although these could be readily distinguished from eight other congeners. The average Kimura 2 parameter distance separating individuals within species was 0.37\%, and the average distance separating species within genera was 7.48\%. Two specimens that clustered with congeners rather than with their identified species-cluster were noted: these could represent instances of hybridisation (although this has not be documented for chondrichthyans), misidentification or mislabelling. It is concluded that cox1 barcoding can be used to identify shark and ray species with a very high degree of accuracy. The sequence variability characteristics of individuals of five species (Aetomylaeus nichofii, Dasyatis kuhlii, Dasyatis leylandi, Himantura gerrardi and Orectolobus maculatus) were consistent with cryptic speciation, and it is suggested that these five taxa be subjected to detailed taxonomic examination to confirm or refute this suggestion. The present barcoding study holds out great hope for the ready identification of sharks, shark products and shark fins, and also highlights some taxonomic issues that need to be investigated further},

	abstract = {The New South Wales (NSW) government has operated a program of netting beaches for the protection of swimmers and surfers against shark attack since 1937 in Sydney, and since 1949 in Newcastle and Wollongong. The scope and directives of the Shark Meshing Program have remained constant since its inception, with operational modifications in net specifications in 1972, changes in spatial deployment in 1972, 1987 and 1992, and the elimination of winter netting since 1989. This markedly increased meshing effort in 1972, and again in 1987. In the present study, we examine the trends in catch and effort for the period from 1950–1951 to 2009–2010 over this 200-km section of the NSW coast. Significant temporal trends in species, size and sex composition are described herein. Catches were consistently dominated by three shark taxa, hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna spp.), whaler sharks (Carcharhinus spp.) and Australian angel sharks (Squatina australis), although their relative contributions to catches varied over time. Catch per unit effort has significantly declined for five of the most abundant shark taxa over the study period, increasing only for a single taxon, the sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus). Catches of larger, potentially dangerous white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) and tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) saw fewer large animals being caught over time. This pattern was not observed across other taxa. Four different monthly trends were observed in landings of the most abundant eight taxa, reflecting differences in the biology of the catch species. The current study also provides useful information on catches and sizes of grey nurse (Carcharias taurus) and white sharks before and after their protection in NSW waters in 1984 and 1998, respectively},

S., Prince, E. D., and Rooker, J. R. 2011. Evaluating post-release behaviour modification in large pelagic fish deployed with pop-up satellite archival tags. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 68: 880–889. Post-release behaviour modification, possibly a result of capture and handling stress, was evaluated using empirical eigenfunction analysis to detect changes in vertical movement patterns recorded by 183 pop-up satellite archival tags (PSATs) deployed on large pelagic fish. Argos-transmitted summary, timed interval, and some archival data were included. Scoring of irregular post-release behaviour was based on a separation of plotted eigenfunction coefficient values by their mean, with the transection across the mean reference line denoting the duration of irregular behaviour. In all, 67 (36.6\%) individual fish exhibited irregular behaviour, lasting from 3 to 60 d (mean = 15.8, s.d. = 10.4). An additional 27 (14.8\%) displayed patterns suggestive of irregular behaviour. Data quality and quantity were important criteria for revealing behaviour patterns. Irregular behaviour was detected in 32.6\% of Argos-transmitted dataseries, increasing to 60.6\% in the higher-resolution archival series. Decreased vertical movement characterized the irregular behaviour of blue sharks (Prionace glauca) and porbeagles (Lamna nasus), whereas all other species showed increased vertical activity. The approach described provides a useful method of revealing behavioural modification during the post-release recovery period of PSAT-tagged large pelagic fish, although the extent of influence on normal behaviour is not fully understood},

Southern bluefin tuna (SBT) were resident in the Tasman Sea for up to 6-�months with movements away from the tagging area occurring at highly variable rates. The data indicated a general tendency for SBT to move south from the tagging area in the Western Tasman Sea. Four individuals migrated west along the southern continental margin of Australia and into the Indian Ocean. Three individuals moved east into the central Tasman Sea, with one individual reaching New Zealand. We also describe the first observed migration of an SBT from the Tasman Sea to the Indian Ocean spawning grounds south of Indonesia. Individuals spent most of their time relatively close to the Australian coast, with an estimated 84\% of time spent in the Australian Fishing Zone. SBT favored temperatures between 19 and 21-�C, adjusting their depth to the vertical temperature distribution. Distinct diurnal diving patterns were observed and adjustment of depth to maintain constant ambient light levels over a 24-h period. The findings of this study are a significant advance toward greater understanding of the spatial dynamics of large SBT and understanding the connectivity between distant regions of their distribution},

We tested transmitters of differing power outputs simultaneously in several trials, some lasting  ̃50 days, to examine the effects of power output and environmental factors (water movement, temperature, lunar cycle and time of day). There were considerable and volatile changes in detections throughout all trials. Increased water movement and temperature significantly reduced detection rates, whereas daytime and full-moon periods had significantly higher detection rates. All nine transmitters (from seven transmitter types tested) showed a sigmoidal trend between detection frequency and distance. Higher-powered transmitters had a prolonged detection distance with near-maximal detections, whereas lower-powered transmitters showed an almost immediate decline. Variation of detection frequency, transmitter type and the modelled relationship between distance and detection frequency were incorporated into a positioning trial which resulted in markedly improved position estimates over previous techniques},

In this study, age- and stage-based demographic analyses were conducted to examine the intrinsic rebound potential (r) and potential risk of fishing for spiny dogfish (Squalus suckleyi) in the Gulf of Alaska. Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to incorporate input parameter uncertainty. For an unfished population, r was estimated to be 0.02�\_"0.03 year�\_"1. Fishing mortalities (F) of FA�=A�0.04 and 0.03 (age- and stage-based models respectively), resulted in rA�=A�0, indicating that populations fished at higher F are not sustainable. Harvest strategies targeting juveniles (age-based model) and subadults (stage-based model) caused the highest risk of the population falling below defined thresholds (BMSY, B40\% and B50\%) after 20 years. The age- and stage-based models provided similar estimates of r and sustainable fishing mortality, suggesting that the stage-based model is an appropriate substitute for the age-based model in this case. S. suckleyi and the closely related S. acanthias are often harvested around the world and this modelling approach could be useful to the management of these species and other sharks where data is limited},

	abstract = {Sharks represent 78\% of the total catch by weight of a Taiwanese surface gill-net fishery off northern Australia. Two carcharhinids, Carcharhrnus tilstoni (previously described as C. limbatus) and C. sorrah, together comprise 83\% of this shark catch by number. C. tilstoni is distinguished from C. limbatus by differences in enzyme systems, vertebral counts, size data and pelvic fin coloration. Of the specimens of C. tilstoni and C. sorrah caught in the Arafura and Timor Seas from 1981 to 1983, 43\% and 47\%, respectively, were female; at birth these proportions were 46\% and 50\%, respectively. In both species, females tended to be relatively more abundant in catches of mature fish, except around March, when males predominated. In northern Australia, the usual size at maturity for C. tilstoni is 110 cm for males and 115 cm for females; for C. sorrah, it is 90 cm and 95 cm, respectively. Both species exhibit placental viviparity and have almost identical restricted reproductive cycles. Mating occurs in February-March, ovulation in March-April and the main parturition period is in January. The gestation period is 10 months and individual fish breed each year. The average litter size for both species is three. The size at birth is about 60 cm for C. tilstoni and 50 cm for C. sorrah. Stomach contents indicate that teleost fish are an important component of the diet of both species and there is some indication of a change in feeding depth with shark size.},

One of the most substantial effects arises from a change of target species. This is particularly important for the Taiwanese distant-water longline fishery, which has a long history of fishery data from two fleets that target various tuna species across three oceans. We review the development of the Taiwanese distant-water longline fishery and compare five designs for standardizing the catch rate of yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) in the western and central Pacific Ocean, using generalized linear models with lognormal and delta-lognormal error assumptions. Two approaches to address targeting effects were tested: separating fishing fleet data based on observer records, and including four target indicators calculated from catch data. Four statistical regions (relating to major fishing grounds) were treated as a single factor in the first three cases and were treated separately for the last two (one independent run for each region). The last case, which involved independent analyses for each fishing fleet for each region, and using the delta-lognormal approach, was considered to provide the most informative standardized CPUE trends for yellowfin tuna},

Between 13 October and 25 November 2006, young of the year and juvenile great white sharks were observed scavenging from the carcass of a humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) in Algoa Bay, South Africa. Although more than one shark scavenged from the carcass, simultaneous feeding was not observed. The sharks showed a clear preference for soft tissue at sites along the mouth of the carcass. Protective ocular rotation was rarely observed and none of the sharks exhibited palatoquadrate protrusion while feeding. These observations provide a new insight into the foraging behaviour of young of the year and juvenile great white sharks. The prevalence of small great white sharks (1.5 m TL) and the absence of any individuals greater than 3.65 m TL suggest that Algoa Bay may function as a nursery area for great white sharks in South Africa. This information is crucial not only to improve our understanding of great white shark biology, but also for their long-term management and conservation in South Africa},

The 1996–97 mean catch rate of sharks and rays, pooled for the main 15 species (or species groups), was  ̃20\% of the 1976–77 mean. Individual catch rates were substantially lower in 1996–97 for 13 of the 15 species or species groups. The greatest decline was observed for dogsharks of the genus Centrophorus, which were most abundant in 1976–77 but rarely caught 20 years later. In contrast, 1996–97 catch rates of spiky dogshark (Squalus megalops) and, to a lesser extent, whitefin swell shark (Cephaloscyllium sp. A) were similar to those in 1976–77. Trawling during 1979–81 provided data for nine species, albeit not corrected for larger gear size, and the pooled mean catch rate for sharks and rays in the depth range 300–525 m was  ̃28\% of the mean for 1976–77.

Over 3-�years, sharks were monitored for periods of 1–37-�days, with individuals regularly moving in and out of the study site. Individual sharks were continuously present within the study site for periods of 1–35-�days. Patterns of movement could not be correlated with time of day. Home range sizes were typically small (average = 1.29-�km2) and did not vary on a yearly basis. Gillnet sampling revealed that juvenile Atlantic sharpnose sharks were present in all habitat types found within Crooked Island Sound, and peaks in abundance varied depending on month within a year.

	abstract = {We used a Markov model to quantify movement rates of tagged sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) among regulatory areas of the North Pacific Fishery Management Council during 1979-1987. The model included natural and fishing mortality, tag reporting and shedding rates, and movement probabilities. Maximum likelihood was used to estimate the parameters of the model. Estimated annual movement rates out of an area were in the range 19-69\% for small (less than 57 cm fork length (FL)), 25-72\% for medium (57-66 cm FL), and 27-71\% for large (more than 66 cm FL) sablefish. The predominant direction of movement along the continental slope was eastward for large sablefish and westward for small sablefish. Most estimates of movement rates were precise, unconfounded, and robust to perturbations of input constants (natural and fishing mortality, and tag reporting rates), except for some imprecise estimates of large sablefish. The results indicate that movement plays an important role in determining the amount of sablefish available for harvest in an area. To account for the interactions among fisheries in different areas, the movement dynamics of sablefish should be incorporated into a stock assessment based on size or age-structure},

Enhanced production inside reserves is predicted to lead to a net larval export and increased settlement and recruitment outside reserve boundaries. However, larval retention in bays is also well documented. Since bays are increasingly being used as reserve areas, planktonic larvae of benthic marine invertebrates were sampled from two semi-enclosed marine reserves during flood and ebb tides to determine whether these bays are acting as net exporters of larvae. Neither reserve was a net importer or exporter of species richness, larval abundance or diversity, although one reserve showed a small export of species richness during the hours of darkness. Both reserves balanced the net import of some species with a net export of others, which was generally related to adult or larval abundance, although exceptions were found in one reserve. Significant effects of light were found, with the net import or export of some species occurring exclusively during either the hours of daylight or darkness. An increased understanding of larval sink-source dynamics in bays is essential for ensuring their effective use as marine reserves to meet specific conservation needs},

The aim of the present study was to investigate the reproductive seasonality and embryo development of C. laticeps using morphological and endocrine parameters. Macroscopic examinations of the reproductive system and embryo stages were recorded. The steroid hormones 17+�- oestradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) were measured in females, and testosterone (T) in both sexes. Females laid eggs throughout the year, but with a peak in egg deposition between January and June. Female T levels were higher in the middle of the year. Elevated P4 values coincided with the period of egg deposition, whereas E2 was depressed in the middle of the egg deposition stage. Females laid eggs in the absence of males for 15 months, and eggs were laid in pairs at monthly intervals. Hatching occurred after 12 months. Variability in gonadosomatic index, percentage of sperm in seminal vesicles, and plasma T levels for males indicated that males were reproductively active throughout the year},

Face-to-face interviews were conducted to identify the main changes in gear and vessel technology that may have improved the fishing efficiency of a number of French, Danish, and Basque fleets over the past few decades. Important changes include the gradual appearance of twin trawls (Danish and French trawlers) and trammel-nets (French gillnetters), and the increased polyvalence of Basque bottom trawlers. The results suggest that fishing effort descriptors that are not traditionally measured (gear type, groundrope type, length of net used per day, headline length, crew size, number of winch or net drums) may have a substantial impact on catch rates. Adjusting fishing effort using such descriptors may generally improve the relationship between fishing effort and fishing mortality},

Our results were compared to previously described stomach contents and isotopic composition of potential preys. Isotopic ratio [delta]15N suggested that tope sharks fed at a higher trophic level (16.7[per mille sign] in the muscle) than the other species, reflecting its piscivorous diet. The lower values of spiny dogfish (11.6[per mille sign] in the muscle) might be explained, amongst other things, by either its migratory behaviour or its preference for preys from lower trophic levels. Cd and Hg were correlated with isotopic ratios [delta]13C and [delta]15N, and were shown to be diet-related whereas Zn, Fe and Cu seemed much more linked to species-specific metabolism. Although this multidisciplinary approach is revealed as a useful tool for the study of shark ecology, the lack of known trophic fractionation suggests that isotopic data be compared to traditional diet analyses},

However, there have been no direct observations of sharks feeding on crab larvae. Whale shark faeces were analysed using genetic testing to confirm the presence of crab larvae in their diet. Primers were designed for amplifying two Gecarcoidea natalis mitochondrial small-subunit (mtSSU) rDNA regions. Gel electrophoresis of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products amplified from whale shark faecal DNA produced bands of the expected size for G. natalis templates. Specificity of both primer sets for G. natalis mtSSU rDNA was expected to be high from comparisons with mtSSU rDNA regions from closely related crabs and we confirmed their specificity empirically. The amplification of fragments from faecal DNA of the same size as those produced from G. natalis DNA indicates that the whale shark had been feeding on G. natalis and that enough of the crab DNA survived digestion to be detected by these PCRs. Our study provides further evidence that aggregations of whale sharks in coastal waters occur in response to ephemeral but predictable increases in planktonic prey},

The condition of these remains indicates that large white sharks can ingest turtles essentially intact.

The white shark may be the chief marine predator of adult chelonians in the Mediterranean Sea, albeit the impact of this predation upon turtle populations is nominal compared to other sources of mortality.

	abstract = {The smooth skate (Malacoraja senta) is a small species of skate that is native to the waters of the north-western Atlantic. Recent assessments in the Gulf of Maine indicate that the biomass of smooth skates has declined below threshold levels mandated by the Sustainable Fisheries Act. This decline, coupled with the paucity of biological data, has prompted the National Marine Fisheries Service to prohibit the possession of smooth skates in this region. Consequently, crucial life history information is now being collected, which could be used in the formulation of a management plan. The present study describes and characterises the reproductive cycle of female and male smooth skates, based on monthly samples taken off the coast of New Hampshire, USA, from May 2001 to April 2002. Gonadosomatic index (GSI), hepatosomatic index (HSI), shell gland weight, follicle size and egg case formation were assessed for 79 female skates. In general, these reproductive parameters remained relatively constant throughout most of the year. Additionally, the size distribution of ovarian follicles in females captured each month did not vary significantly. For males (n = 81), histological stages of spermatogenesis III to VI (SIII-SVI), GSI and HSI were examined. No significant differences were detected in male reproductive parameters, and production and maintenance of mature spermatocysts within the testes were observed throughout the year. Collectively, these findings indicate that, like other north Atlantic skate species, the smooth skate is reproductively active year-round},

Non-metric multivariate analyses of volumetric contributions of dietary categories to stomach contents demonstrated that the dietary compositions of the rays Myliobatis australis and Aptychotrema vincentiana and the sharks Heterodontus portusjacksoni and Squatina australis in south-western Australian waters differed. M. australis fed predominantly on benthic invertebrates, whereas A. vincentiana consumed large volumes of teleosts. The durophagous H. portusjacksoni ingested a wide variety of prey, including gastropods, cephalopods, bivalves, echinoderms and teleosts, whereas S. australis ingested mainly teleosts and cephalopods. The extent and pattern of change in the diet with increasing body size varied among species. For example, the diet of H. portusjacksoni changed abruptly to larger, harder-bodied prey at  ̃400-mm total length, whereas that of S. australis underwent small, gradual changes with increasing body size. The diets of each species changed seasonally. Inter- and intraspecific variations in dietary composition reduce the potential for competition between and within these abundant elasmobranch species in south-western Australian waters},

The use in assessments of survey results rather than future commercial catch rates leads to a marked improvement in the ability to satisfy the legislative management objective for Australian fisheries of Ecological Sustainable Development, especially if future catch rates are not related linearly to abundance or if catchability is density-dependent.

	abstract = {Although the movements of fishes on coral reefs have been well studied, there are few data on the movement of elasmobranchs on and around cleaning stations. The visitation to cleaning stations by elasmobranchs was documented by direct observation and remote video capture at an oceanic reef in the Coral Sea and the outer Great Barrier Reef at time scales of hours to weeks. Cleaning was only observed at Osprey Reef and duration of occupancy was recorded for all elasmobranch clients. Strong tidal patterns were detected, with 49\% of sharks and 59\% of mantas engaging in cleaning interactions on ebb tides. Forty-four per cent of non-cleaned sharks were also observed on ebb tides. Some manta rays (n = 19) were individually identified through ventral skin pigmentation to determine site fidelity; three were seen more than once with repeat observations occurring within days. This was consistent among weeks and days within weeks, regardless of time of day. Hypotheses for tidal behaviour are discussed and we argue that these observations are critical in elucidating previously unknown behaviours in elasmobranch ecology. Our study indicates that observations of large elasmobranchs at cleaning stations are another tool to elucidate elasmobranch ecology},

One reason for the disparity is that marlin have not yet been successfully held in captivity. Progress has been made in elucidating the trophic biology of billfish and these data are helping to build models of pelagic ecosystem dynamics. The deployment of several types of electronic tags has expedited advances in understanding the short-term movements and depth distribution of billfish, but long-term tracks remain elusive. In part, this may be because insufficient effort has been directed at developing methods for restraining marlin for tag attachment or implantation. Light-based geolocation techniques show great promise for elucidating billfish movements, but appropriate scientific rigour must be applied to the publication of these data. Several suggestions for advancing billfish research are presented.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Catch and effort data from a fishery-independent longline survey in the western North Atlantic were used to investigate the biology, distribution and abundance of pelagic sharks. Data were restricted to the period from 1977 to 1994, and for the months of June-August. Catches were dominated by the blue shark (Prionace glauca), with smaller numbers of shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus), porbeagle (Lamna nasus), thresher (Alopias spp.) and silky (Carcharhinus falciformis) sharks. Detailed analysis was restricted to P. glauca due to small sample sizes for the other species. Male blue sharks were caught more often than females. The catches included juveniles and adults of both sexes but very few adult females. Annual sex ratios varied, but normally favored males. Monthly sex ratios were even in June, but favored males in July and August. Due to differences in occurrence between males and females, distribution and abundance data were analyzed separately for each sex. Male catch per unit effort (CPUE) was highest between 15 and 20��C, while female CPUE peaked at approximately 15��C and decreased with increasing water temperatures. CPUE for males and females were standardized using a generalized linear model with years, months and day-night as factors. Males showed an approximately 80\% decline between the mid-1980s and the early 1990s, while a significant change in female catch rates could not be demonstrated. The results of the analyses are discussed in relation to fishery-dependent studies in the western North Atlantic, along with previous work on the biology and distribution of pelagic sharks},

	abstract = {A young of the year female white shark, Carcharodon carcharias, was tagged with a pop-up satellite archival tag off Southern California in early June of 2000. The tag was recovered after 28 days, and records of temperature, depth and light intensity were extracted. Depth and temperature records indicate a number of interesting behaviors, including a strong diurnal pattern. At night the shark remained in the top 50 m, often making shallow repetitive vertical excursions. Most dives below the mixed layer were observed during the day, 91\% of which occurred from 05:00 to 21:00 h, with depths extending to 240 m. Many of the dives exhibited secondary vertical movements that were consistent with the shark swimming at the bottom (at depths from 9 to 165 m) where it was most likely foraging. The white shark experienced dramatic and rapid changes in temperature, and demonstrated a considerable tolerance for cold waters. Temperatures ranged from 9C to 22C, and although 89\% of the total time was spent in waters 16–22C, on some days the small shark spent as much as 32\% of the time in 12C waters. The deep dives into cold waters separate the white sharks from mako sharks, which share the California Bight nursery ground but appear to remain primarily in the mixed layer and thermocline. Movement information (derived from light-based geolocation, bottom depths and sea surface temperatures) indicated that the white shark spent the 28 days in the Southern California Bight, possibly moving as far south as San Diego, California. While the abundance and diversity of prey, warm water and separation from adults make this region an ideal nursery ground, the potential for interaction with the local fisheries should be examined},

	abstract = {Mustelus antarcticus, endemic to southern Australia, exhibits matrotrophic aplacental viviparity. Differences in synchronous ovarian and parturition cycles, mostly annual west and biennial east of longitude 138-�E, are explained by environmental differences. Ovulation and parturition peak during November–December and the gestation period is  ̃12 months. Largest ovarian follicle diameter ranges from 15 to 28 mm at ovulation, and mean wet mass gain is 10-fold from in utero egg ( ̃10 g) to full-term embryo ( ̃100 g) at  ̃330 mm total length. The sex ratio of embryos in utero is 1:1, and litter size (1 to 57 embryos) rises curvilinearly with maternal length. Length-at-maternity and length-at-maturity increased with rising fishing mortality and subsequently decreased with falling fishing mortality. These patterns are explained by the hypothesis on the ‘phenomenon of apparent change of size-at-maternity' (and size-at-maturity) caused by gill-net length-selective fishing mortality, which masks any potential density-dependent responses. Male length-at-maturity estimates from seminal vesicle condition, testis development and spermatogenesis stages are similar, but are less than estimates from clasper calcification. Maximum body mass of females is double that of males and, at any length {\textgreater}700 mm, mean body mass of females exceeds that of males},

	abstract = {Age-specific demographic data are not available for many species of conservation concern, and conservation biologists must rely on incomplete demographic data which can be collected much more easily. Models that allow demographic analyses based on incomplete demographic data have recently received substantial attention. Such models (hereafter, partial life-cycle models) are particularly appropriate for situations where age-specific demographic data are not available, and when perturbation analyses involving ages at first and last reproduction are desired. Here, I present a partial life-cycle model appropriate for the analyses of incomplete demographic data collected from post-breeding censuses when estimates of age at last reproduction are not available. Using example calculations, I have shown that results of the simple model resemble those obtained from corresponding age-structured models, and that ignoring age at last reproduction for demographic analyses of long-lived organisms results in little or no loss of information. These results justify the use of the simple model presented here, and should be encouraging to investigators working on long-lived organisms for which estimates of age at last reproduction are rarely available},

	abstract = {A simple (deterministic) population dynamics model is used to examine the level of fishing mortality at which a population is expected to be driven to extinction (F crash). Values for F crash are determined for six marine fish species (Cape hake, blue grenadier, blue warehou, school shark, gummy shark, and orange roughy) subject to commercial harvest. The sensitivity of the value of F crash to changing the selectivity pattern of the fishery and the relationship between the size of the reproductive component of the population and subsequent births to allow for depensatory effects is examined. F crash is greatest for highly productive species and when the fishery does not target immature animals. The ratio of F crash to the fishing mortality at which maximum sustainable yield is achieved, F MSY, is a decreasing function of the productivity of the population. The possibility of depensation has little impact on F MSY but can substantially reduce the ratio F crash/F MSY. A series of stochastic simulations is conducted to assess the probability of detecting that the extent of fishing exceeds F crash using the current IUCN A criterion. The results of these simulations are also used to determine the probability that the IUCN A criteria will be triggered when fishing takes place at F MSY. The results indicate that there are substantial probabilities of incorrectly identifying species being harvested at F MSY as being threatened during the 'fishing down' phase and also of not identifying species actually at risk of extinction if fishing mortality is not reduced},

	abstract = {The white shark, Carcharodon carcharias, has a complex life history that is characterized by large scale movements and a highly variable diet. Estimates of age and growth for the white shark from the eastern North Pacific Ocean indicate they have a slow growth rate and a relatively high longevity. Age, growth, and longevity estimates useful for stock assessment and fishery models, however, require some form of validation. By counting vertebral growth band pairs, ages can be estimated, but because not all sharks deposit annual growth bands and many are not easily discernable, it is necessary to validate growth band periodicity with an independent method. Radiocarbon (14C) age validation uses the discrete 14C signal produced from thermonuclear testing in the 1950s and 1960s that is retained in skeletal structures as a time-specific marker. Growth band pairs in vertebrae, estimated as annual and spanning the 1930s to 1990s, were analyzed for +�14C and stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes (+�13C and +�15N). The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of 14C age validation for a wide-ranging species with a complex life history and to use stable isotope measurements in vertebrae as a means of resolving complexity introduced into the 14C chronology by ontogenetic shifts in diet and habitat. Stable isotopes provided useful trophic position information; however, validation of age estimates was confounded by what may have been some combination of the dietary source of carbon to the vertebrae, large-scale movement patterns, and steep 14C gradients with depth in the eastern North Pacific Ocean},

However, they require valid estimates of age-specific mortality and natality rates, in addition to information on the distribution, abundance, habits and reproduction of the population, to produce reliable estimates of population growth. Because such detailed ecological information is usually unavailable, complete demographic analyses have been completed for only four shark species: the spiny dogfish, Squalus acanthias; the soupfin shark, Galeorhinus australis; the lemon shark, {\textless}I{\textgreater}Negaprion brevirostris{\textless}/I{\textgreater}; and most recently the sandbar shark, {\textless}I{\textgreater}Carcharhinus plumbeus{\textless}/I{\textgreater}. In California, reliable estimates of age, growth, mortality, age at maturity, and fecundity are available only for the leopard shark, {\textless}I{\textgreater}Triakis semifasciata{\textless}/I{\textgreater}. A demographic analysis of this species yielded a net reproductive rate (R$_{\textrm{o}}$) of 4.467, a generation time (G) of 22.35 years, and an estimate of the instantaneous population growth coefficient (r) of 0.067. If the mean fishing pressure over 10 years (F= 0.084) is included in the survivorship function, R$_{\textrm{o}}$ and r are reduced considerably, especially if leopard sharks first enter the fishery at early ages.

	abstract = {Tricaine methanesulfonate (TMS) is an anesthetic that is approved for provisional use in some jurisdictions such as the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom (UK). Many hatcheries and research studies use TMS to immobilize fish for marking or transport and to suppress sensory systems during invasive procedures. Improper TMS use can decrease fish viability, distort physiological data, or result in mortalities. Because animals may be anesthetized by junior staff or students who may have little experience in fish anesthesia, training in the proper use of TMS may decrease variability in recovery, experimental results and increase fish survival. This document acts as a primer on the use of TMS for anesthetizing juvenile salmonids, with an emphasis on its use in surgical applications. Within, we briefly describe many aspects of TMS including the legal uses for TMS, and what is currently known about the proper storage and preparation of the anesthetic. We outline methods and precautions for administration and changes in fish behavior during progressively deeper anesthesia and discuss the physiological effects of TMS and its potential for compromising fish health. Despite the challenges of working with TMS, it is currently one of the few legal options available in the USA and in other countries until other anesthetics are approved and is an important tool for the intracoelomic implantation of electronic tags in fish},

	abstract = {Catch-curve analysis is one of the simplest methods for stock assessment and is widely applied in data-poor fisheries. Conventional catch-curve methods rely on the strong assumptions of constant fishing and natural mortality rates above some fully selected age that is usually estimated by visually inspecting a plot of catch at age. Here, we evaluate the performance of three catch-curve methods that relax or modify these assumptions by (1) estimating logistic selectivity parameters, (2) assuming Lorenzen-form natural mortality (natural mortality that decreases with weight), and (3) using both methods simultaneously. We used simulation modeling and decision tables to compare estimates of fishing mortality from four catch-curve methods, including the conventional method, across a variety of observable and unobservable data characteristics. We then applied the methods to catch-at-age data for Atlantic menhaden \textit{Brevoortia tyrannus} from the U.S. South Atlantic fishery management region and compared the resulting estimates with published estimates of fishing mortality (\textit{F}). In our simulation modeling, catch curves that estimated logistic selectivity parameters performed better than those derived by the conventional method when logistic selectivity was present. There was generally little difference in performance between estimates assuming constant natural mortality and those assuming Lorenzen natural mortality. The improvements from estimating selectivity parameters were particularly pronounced when the sample sizes for catch-at-age data were large: in those instances, estimating selectivity improved the estimation accuracy for \textit{F} by nearly 20\%. In our example involving Atlantic menhaden, estimates of \textit{F} assuming logistic selectivity were most similar to those of published stock assessments, which had previously estimated logistic selectivity at age. We recommend our logistic-selectivity catch curve when selectivity is likely to be logistic because it improves accuracy at only a very small cost in terms of computational complexity},

	url = {http://icesjms.oxfordjournals.org/content/61/8/1443.abstract},
	abstract = {Numerous studies have proposed methodologies to model fisher behaviour with the aim of predicting the outcomes of decision-making on board a fishing vessel. Both short- and long-term processes (e.g. investment) impact fleet dynamics. The proposed structure of the models has tended to depend upon the nature of the fishery and the control variables (technical restrictions, quotas, effort control, and/or closed areas). For example, within the context of multi-stock, multi-fleet fisheries (mixed fisheries), a skipper will allocate effort (as input to the production process) to harvest a range of species. Spatial complexity is normally excluded in models of behaviour. In this paper, two spatial analyses are presented for modelling location choice: an analysis based on a random utility model (RUM), and a simplified simulation model of individual vessels that depends on the results of the RUM. These models are applied to the English beam-trawl fleet operating in the North Sea in 2000. The results from the RUM indicate that the number of trips, the average trip length, and the average effort in each ICES rectangle are significant variables affecting location choice, in addition to catch rate for the previous year (1999), weighted by value. The last result is used as an assumption in a simulation model of fishing effort, i.e. fishers make decisions on spatial location of operation on the basis of past catch rates. The simulation model is used to predict the distribution of the same fleet for one month during the temporary closure in the North Sea in 2001. The predicted values for effort relate well to the fishing patterns observed},

	abstract = {Recent advances in electronic tag technology have resulted in an explosion of data for marine biologists. Providing descriptions of data management systems and discussion of their strengths and weaknesses will be important in promoting a dialogue with the ultimate goal of building better systems to support research. The importance of this will only increase as large multinational, multi-institutional studies become more common. Modern memory components permit a single archival tag to collect many megabytes of data. Effective handling of the volume of data generated by multiple tag deployments is a major challenge, and an essential step before data analysis can be performed. Tags are deployed on multiple species and a single animal may carry several different tag types. Data handling systems must be flexible enough to accommodate the variety of ways tags are used, as well as the changes to tag specifications over time. This paper describes a relational database system that has been developed to meet these requirements. This database stores data from a variety of electronic tags from different manufacturers, including archival tags, satellite tags and acoustic tags. The data are downloaded, processed and stored automatically where possible. Centralising data storage allows flexibility in data access, quality control, exploration and analysis. Software programs allow access to the data from local servers or via the internet and include initial visualization of animal tracks via a mapping system. A suite of environmental data and products can also be matched to the selected track(s), which aids initial analyses and development and refinement of scientific hypotheses},

	abstract = {Shortfin mako sharks were aged by counting growth bands in sectioned vertebrae (n = 256), and assuming annual band-pair deposition. No systematic ageing bias was present and count precision was high. 0+ juveniles were identified from length–frequency plots and assigned ages based on a theoretical birth date of 1 October and their date of capture. A Schnute generalised growth model fitted to the combined vertebral and 0+ data described the growth patterns best. Shortfin makos grow very rapidly initially, increasing by  ̃39 cm fork length in their first year. Thereafter, males and females grow at similar but slower rates until about age 7 years, after which the relative growth of males declines. Longevity estimates were 29 and 28 years for males and females respectively. Natural mortality (M) is probably in the range of 0.10–0.15. Median ages at maturity were 7–9 years for males and 19–21 years for females. Comparisons of growth curves reported here and elsewhere suggest no regional differences in growth rates. The shortfin mako is a late-maturing species with moderate longevity and low natural mortality. With these life history characteristics and an unknown stock size and structure worldwide, management should be of a precautionary nature},

In total, 125 C. taurus juveniles and 178 C. taurus maturing subadults and adults were recaptured, representing recapture rates of 11.2\% and 7.5\% respectively. The average distance travelled by juvenile sharks was 18.7 km (95\% CI = 10.8–26.6 km). Juvenile sharks displayed site fidelity to summer nursery areas. The average distance travelled by maturing and adult sharks was 342 km (95\% CI = 275–409 km). One female shark, however, was recaptured 1897 km from its original release site. The average rate at which pregnant sharks moved south from their gestation to pupping grounds was 2.6 km day–1 (95\% CI = 2.04–3.16 km day–1).

This study used photo-identification from community-contributed photographs to reveal patterns in movements, reproductive biology, and fisheries interactions in this species that have not been previously revealed through more traditional methods. At least 178 individual sharks were identified, and 26 movements were observed. These included movement distances of up to 26.4 km, movement rates of up to 3.27 km/day (9.8 km in 3 days), and movements that required the transit of a 140 m deep channel. Other animals showed high philopatry, being re-sighted at the same locality on multiple occasions (up to 13 sightings for one individual) over periods of up to 7 years. Females showed higher philopatry than males and were more likely than males to be found at shallow (\&lt;10 m depth) localities throughout the year. The proportion of male sightings at shallow localities was significantly higher in April and May than other months of the year, possibly due to males coming into the shallows to mate with females. A peak in sightings of late-term females followed by an abrupt decline suggests that pupping season is May into early June, and two females were observed pregnant in consecutive years despite evidence that the gestation period is approximately 1 year for this species. Nine percent of animals carried fishing tackle or exhibited jaw injuries associated with fishery interactions, with multiple individuals found dead after being hooked by fishers},

	abstract = {Demonstrating ecological sustainability is a challenge for fisheries worldwide, and few methods can quantify fishing impacts on diverse, low value or rare species. The current study employed a widely used ecological risk assessment method and incorporated new data to assess the change in sustainability of species following the introduction of Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) in Australia’s Northern Prawn Fishery (NPF). Population recovery ranks changed for 19 of the 56 elasmobranch species after the introduction of TEDs, with nine species showing an increase in sustainability. Unexpectedly, ten species showed a decrease in sustainability. This was due to TEDs successfully excluding large animals from the catch, resulting in a lower mean length at capture, which reduced the recovery ranks for two criteria relying on length data. This falsely indicates that TEDs increase the impact on pre-breeding animals, thus reducing the recovery potential of these species. The results demonstrate that existing attribute-based risk assessment methods may be inadequate for reflecting even the most obvious changes in fishing impacts on bycatch species. Industry and management can benefit greatly from an approach that more accurately estimates absolute risk. The development and requirements of a new quantitative risk assessment method to be developed for the NPF, and applicable to fisheries worldwide, are discussed},

	abstract = {Tracking marine animals with electronic tags has become an indispensable tool in understanding biology in relation to movement. Combining light based geolocation estimates with an underlying movement model has proved helpful in reconstructing the most probable track of tagged animals. These tracks can be further improved by including the tag measured sea-surface temperature and matching it to external sea-surface temperature (SST) data. The current methodology for doing this in a state-space model requires that external sea-surface temperature be smoothed before it is used in the model, and further that its gradient field is pre-calculated. This two-step approach has a number of technical drawbacks, and the final statistical inference about the most probable track is consequently less convincing. This paper presents a new methodology (refer to as UKFSST) where all steps, including the SST smoothing, are handled within one coherent model. An additional benefit is that even the degree of smoothing, which was previously pre-determined and fixed, can now be optimally selected. UKFSST offers better handling of non-linearities in Kalman filter, and provides a statistically sound model for geolocation applications, as opposed to ad hoc SST matching approaches},

The status of the stock is ambiguous due to the limitations of the fishery-dependent data. This study presents a spatially structured tagging model to estimate blue shark movement and fishing mortality rates in the North Atlantic Ocean. The model uses the blue shark tag-recovery data collected by the United States National Marine Fisheries Service Cooperative Shark Tagging Program (1965–2004). Four major geographical regions (two on each side of the ocean) are assumed. The blue shark fishing mortality rates (F) were found to be heterogeneous across the four regions. While the estimates of F obtained for the western North Atlantic Ocean were historically lower than 0.1 year–1, the F estimates over the most recent decade (1990s) in the eastern side of the ocean are rapidly approaching 0.2 year–1. Because of the particular life-history of the blue shark, these results suggest careful monitoring of the fishery as the juvenile and pregnant female segments of the stock are highly vulnerable to exploitation in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean},

	abstract = {There is a need to explore, in an integrated and statistical manner, how the number of species, relative abundance, species composition and life-cycle stages of elasmobranchs in nearshore waters vary among habitat types and during the year. Therefore, four sites in a large marine embayment, each representing a different habitat type, were sampled at regular intervals. These sites were: (1) unvegetated, with no vegetation within at least 200-�m; (2) unvegetated, immediately adjacent to sparse mangroves; (3) unvegetated, immediately adjacent to dense mangroves; and (4) vegetated, with seagrass ( Posidonia australis) throughout and in the vicinity. Gill netting caught 10 shark species (5 families), 5 ray species (4 families) and 12 teleost species (10 families). Carcharhinus cautus, which contributed approximately 60\% to the numbers of elasmobranchs caught, completed its life cycle in nearshore, shallow waters. Negaprion acutidens, Carcharhinus brevipinna, Carcharhinus limbatus and Rhizoprionodon acutus used these waters as a nursery area. C. cautus was caught mainly in the unvegetated sites, particularly in those near mangroves. N. acutidens was caught entirely in unvegetated sites, while R. acutus, C. brevipinna and Chiloscyllium punctatum were caught predominantly or exclusively in seagrass. The mean number of species and mean catch rate of elasmobranchs were greatest for the seagrass site and least for the unvegetated site with no vegetation within at least 200-�m and were significantly less for the latter site than for the unvegetated site immediately adjacent to dense mangroves ( PPP\&lt;0.05). We conclude that the spatial and food resources in the nearshore, shallow waters of Shark Bay are partitioned among elasmobranch species, thus reducing the potential for competition among these species for the resources in those waters},

	abstract = {Calls to use target, limit and threshold reference points to achieve precautionary management goals have increased substantially in recent years. For many fisheries there is little chance of conducting formal stock assessments, and indicators of stock status have to be based on changes in measurable quantities such as catch rates and percentiles of the length distribution of the catch. Use of such empirical indicators for management decisions also requires a choice of appropriate reference or trigger levels for the indicators. Monte Carlo simulation can be used to examine the performance of alternative indicators and associated reference points in terms of their ability to correctly identify the biological conditions that they were designed to measure. This study examines the performance of several potential empirical indicators for broadbill swordfish off eastern Australia, taking into account uncertainties in stock structure, current status, and future trends in fishing effort. Indicators based on catch rates are shown to be potentially very misleading. In contrast, indicators based on the mean length or mean weight of the catch perform better, because these quantities change in a more predictable manner with abundance. Nevertheless, reference points based on these quantities are frequently \&\#8216;triggered\&\#8217; either too early or too late.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {There was a non-linear relationship between daily catch and effort within the NSW abalone fishery between 1983 and 1995. Larger catches were collected at a faster rate than small catches. To account for this, a generalized linear model was fitted which described the observed effort as a function of catch and several other standardizing variables. This model provided indices of catch rate that were significantly different from those derived from a more traditional analysis of CPUE which does not account for the non-linear relationship between catch and effort. Changes in indices of catch rate from the analysis of catch and effort were associated with major management changes, including increases in the minimum length limit and the introduction of individual quotas. Increases in catch rate between 1992 and 1995 were not associated with changes in management, and suggest that densities and abundance of abalone on the NSW coast may have increased. This interpretation is strengthened when catch rates are considered in conjunction with independent surveys of abundance. Calculation of standardized indices of catch rate that acknowledge the non-linear relationship between catch and effort, and their interpretation in conjunction with other information, is likely to improve the potential of catch rate as an indicator of change within the NSW abalone fishery},

An individual-based model is formulated as a biased random walk model in which the velocity of each fish has both a deterministic and a stochastic component. These components are function of a habitat suitability index, h, and its spatial gradient [backward difference]h. We derive an advection-diffusion partial differential equation (PDE) which approximates this individual-based model (IBM). The approximation process enables us to obtain a mechanistic representation of the advection and diffusion coefficients which improves the heuristic approaches of former studies. Advection and diffusion are linked and exhibit antagonistic behaviors: strong advection goes with weak diffusion leading to a directed movement of fish. On the contrary weak advection goes with strong diffusion corresponding to a searching behavior. Simulations are conducted for both models which are compared by computing spatial statistics. It is shown that the PDE model is a good approximation to the IBM},

These models are generally density independent and provide an instantaneous rate of population growth for a specified set of life history traits that correspond to a specific population size. Many investigators are using these models to compute rates of population growth that they claim are estimates of the maximum population growth rate (\textit{r}$_{\textrm{intrinsic}}$); they then use these estimates to compute purported estimates of maximum sustainable fishing mortality. However, neither a Leslie matrix nor a life table can be used to estimate \textit{r}$_{\textrm{intrinsic}}$ without additional information, except in the special case where a severely depleted population is modeled. Only in a severely depleted population will competition for resources be at a minimum and both density-dependent compensation and the rate of population growth be at a maximum (i.e., at \textit{r}$_{\textrm{intrinsic}}$). The fundamental problem is to determine the life history parameters that would occur if the population were extremely depleted because extensive observations on extremely depleted populations are rare. In the absence of such data, \textit{r}$_{\textrm{intrinsic}}$ can only be estimated from these types of density-independent models by extrapolating observed population growth rates toward zero population size. We illustrate the problems in, and describe methods for, estimating \textit{r}$_{\textrm{intrinsic}}$ and present information on two species of elasmobranch: barndoor skate \textit{Dipturus laevis} and lemon shark \textit{Negaprion brevirostris}},

I used age-structured life tables and Leslie matrices based on a prebreeding survey and a yearly time step applied only to females to model the demography of 41 populations from 38 species of sharks representing four orders and nine families. I used Monte Carlo simulation to reflect uncertainty in the estimates of demographic traits and to calculate population statistics and elasticities for these populations; I used correlation analysis to identify the demographic traits that explained most of the variation in population growth rates (-�++-�). The populations I examined fell along a continuum of life-history characteristics that can be linked to elasticity patterns. Sharks characterized by early age at maturity, short lifespan, and large litter size had high ++ values and short generation times, whereas sharks that mature late and have long lifespans and small litters have low ++ values and long generation times. Sharks at the “fast” end of the spectrum tended to have comparable adult and juvenile survival elasticities, whereas sharks at the “slow” end of the continuum had high juvenile survival elasticity and low age–zero survival (-�or fertility-�) elasticity. Ratios of adult survival to fertility elasticities and juvenile survival to fertility elasticities suggest that many of the populations studied do not possess the biological attributes necessary to restore ++ to its original level after moderate levels of exploitation. Elasticity analysis suggests that changes in juvenile survival would have the greatest effect on ++, and correlation analysis indicates that variation in juvenile survival, age at maturity, and reproduction account for most of the variation in ++.

Las poblaciones examinadas caen dentro de un continuo de caracter+�sticas de historias de vida que pueden estar vinculadas con los patrones de elasticidad. Los tiburones que maduran a temprana edad y tienen corta duraci+�n de vida y grupos grandes de cr+�as tuvieron valores altos de ++ y tiempos generacionales cortos, mientras que los tiburones que maduran tarde y tienen una duraci+�n de vida larga y grupos peque+�os de cr+�as tienen valores bajos de ++ y tiempos generacionales largos. Los tiburones que se encuentran en el punto final “r+�pido” del espectro tendieron a tener elasticidades de supervivencia de adultos y juveniles comparables, mientras que los tiburones en el punto final “lento” del continuo tuvieron una alta elasticidad de supervivencia de juveniles y una baja elasticidad en supervivencia a la edad cero (o fertilidad-�). Las proporciones de elasticidades de supervivencia de adultos y fertilidad y de elasticidades de supervivencia de juveniles y fertilidad sugieren que muchas de las poblaciones estudiadas no poseen los atributos biol+�gicos necesarios para restaurar ++ a su nivel original despu+�s de niveles moderados de explotaci+�n. El an+�lisis de elasticidad sugiere que en la supervivencia de juveniles se podr+�a tener el efecto mayor de ++ y el an+�lisis de correlaci+�n indica que la variaci+�n en la supervivencia de juveniles, la edad de maduraci+�n y reproducci+�n explican la mayor parte de la variaci+�n en ++. En general, los resultados combinados de los an+�lisis de elasticidad y correlaci+�n sugieren que los esfuerzos de investigaci+�n, conservaci+�n y manejo deber+�an enfocarse a estas caracter+�sticas demogr+�ficas},

	abstract = {The great hammerhead shark, Sphyrna mokarran, is a cosmopolitan species that is caught in a variety of fisheries throughout much of its range. The apparent decline of great hammerhead shark populations has reinforced the need for accurate biological data to enhance fishery management plans. To this end, age and growth estimates for the great hammerhead were determined from sharks (n-�=-�216) ranging in size from 54- to 315-cm fork length (FL), captured in the Gulf of Mexico and north-western Atlantic Ocean. Growth curves were fitted using multiple models and evaluated using Akaike’s information criterion. The von Bertalanffy growth model was the best fitting model, with resulting growth parameters of L��P-�=-�264.2-cm FL, k-�=-�0.16 year–1, t0-�=-�–1.99 year for males, and L��P-�=-�307.8-cm FL, k-�=-�0.11 year–1, t0-�=-�–2.86 year for females. Annual band pair deposition was confirmed through marginal-increment analysis and a concurrent bomb radiocarbon validation study. Great hammerheads have one of the oldest reported ages for any elasmobranch (44 years) but grow at relatively similar rates (on the basis of von Bertalanffy k value) to other large hammerhead species from this region. The present study is the first to provide vertebral ages for great hammerheads},

	abstract = {The gillnet data of walleye (Sander vitreus), yellow perch (Perca flavescens), and white perch (Morone americana), collected by a fishery-independent survey (Lake Eire Partnership Index Fishing Survey, PIS) from 1989 to 2008, contained 75-83\% of zero observations. AdaBoost algorithm was applied to the model analyses with such fishery data for each species. The 3- and 5-fold cross-validations were conducted to evaluate the performance of each candidate model. The performance of the delta model consisting of one generalized additive model and one AdaBoost model (Delta-AdaBoost) was compared with five candidate models. The five candidate models included: the delta model comprising two generalized linear models (Delta-GLM), the delta model comprising two generalized linear models with polynomial terms up to degree 3 (Delta-GLM-Poly), the delta model comprising two generalized additive models (Delta-GAM), the generalized linear model with Tweedie distribution (GLM-Tweedie), and the generalized additive model with Tweedie distribution (GAM-Tweedie). To predict the presence/absence of fish species, the performance of AdaBoost model was compared in terms of error rate with conventional generalized linear and additive models assuming a binomial distribution. Results from 3- and 5-fold cross-validation indicated that Delta-AdaBoost model yielded the smallest training error (0.431-0.433 for walleye, 0.528-0.519 for yellow perch and 0.251 for white perch) and test error (0.435-0.436 for walleye, 0.524 for yellow perch and 0.254-0.255 for white perch) on average, followed by Delta-GLM-Poly model for yellow perch and white perch, and Delta-GAM model for walleye. In the prediction of the presence/absence of fish species, AdaBoost model had the lowest error rate, compared with generalized linear and additive models. We suggested AdaBoost algorithm to be an alternative to deal with the high percentage of zero observations in the catch and bycatch analyses in fisheries studies},

Bands on the second dorsal spine were used to obtain age estimates. The number of bands on the external surface of the spine and within the inner dentine layer increased with animal length. Most spines had more bands on the external surface, and the rate of band formation was significantly different between the external surface and the inner dentine layer. Females had a maximum of 57 external bands and 26 internal bands, while males had up to 48 external bands and 22 internal bands. Age estimates from external bands suggest maturity (A 50) at 20 years for males and 30 years for females. Internal band age estimates suggest maturity at 10.5 years for males and 11.5 years for females. Although there is a large discrepancy between these two preliminary (i.e., unvalidated) age estimates, they both suggest that E. baxteri is a long-lived and late maturing species that is likely to be susceptible to over fishing},

	abstract = {The present paper suggests a method for estimating the fishing power of vessels and for analysing fleet dynamics. The approach is based on quantification of stocks catchability (q), derived from fishing mortality coefficients (F) as calculated by virtual population analysis. Catchabilities for each harvested stock are thus estimated relatively to the fishing effort (fn) of each vessel, according to the equation: q = (F/fn). A linear model is then fitted to these catchabilities. The model allows the identification and quantification of trends in average mortality rates per fishing hour for each stock. Under some assumptions, trends are interpreted as variations in the overall fishing power of each fleet. The approach is applied to three industrial and semi-industrial fleets of Brittany (Lorient, Concarneau and Douarnenez) and to the main gadoid stocks they exploit off the west coast of Scotland (ICES area VIa), and in the Celtic Sea (ICES area VIIf,g,h) for Concameau. Results show large variations in fishing power. Particularly, a marked increase trend in the fishing power exerted on saithe (Pollachius virens) is highlighted for the three fleets, over the period 1983-1989. These variations can be explained by the redirection of fishing strategies, which may occur on a large scale. Thus, we show how the collapse of saithe stock at first led the three fleets to intensify the harvesting of saithe, and from 1989 on, to adopt different strategies. The possible causes of the observed dynamics are discussed, as well as their consequences for fisheries management. In particular, the relevance of direct control of fishing effort as a regulatory tool is questioned.R�sum� On propose ici une m�thode d'estimation des puissances de p�che des navires et d'analyse de la dynamique des flottilles. L'approche s'appuie sur une quantification de la capturabilit� (q) des stocks � partir des coefficients de mortalit� par p�che (F) issus de l'analyse des cohortes. Les capturabilit�s de chaque stock exploit� sont ainsi estim�es relativement � l'effort de p�che (fn) d�velopp� par chaque navire, selon la relation: q = (F/fn). Une mod�lisation lin�aire des capturabilit�s est ensuite effectu�e. Elle permet d'identifier et quantifier les tendances des mortalit�s moyennes par heure de p�che appliqu�es � chaque stock. Sous certaines hypoth�ses, ces tendances sont interpr�t�es comme des variations de puissances de p�che d�velopp�es par chacune des flottilles. La m�thode est appliqu�e aux trois flottilles industrielles ou semi-industrielles de Bretagne sud (Lorient, Concarneau et Douarnenez) et aux principaux stocks qu'elles exploitent dans la zone nord-ouest d'+cosse (zone CIEM VIa), et en mer Celtique (zone CIEM VIIf,g,h) pour Concarneau. Les r�sultats montrent d'importantes variations des puissances de p�che. En particulier, un important accroissement de la puissance de p�che d�velopp�e sur le lieu noir (Pollachius virens) est mis en �vidence pour les (rois flottilles, sur la p�riode 1983-1989. Ces variations s'expliquent notamment par des modifications de strat�gies de p�che, qui peuvent �tre de grande ampleur. On montre ainsi comment l'effondrement du stock de lieu noir a conduit d'abord � une strat�gie d'intensification de son exploitation, puis, � partir de 1989. � des strat�gies diff�rentes pour chacune des trois flottilles. Les raisons susceptibles d'expliquer les dynamiques observ�es sont discut�es, ainsi que leurs cons�quences en terme de gestion des p�ches. La pertinence d'une r�gulation directe de l'effort de p�che est notamment remise en question},

Age estimates were obtained through vertebral centra analysis of 187 sharks. We verified our age estimates through marginal increment analysis of centra and oxytetracycline marking methods of at liberty sandbar sharks. Sizes of sampled sharks ranged from 46 to 147 cm pre-caudal length. Four growth models were fitted to length-at-age data; two forms of the von Bertalanffy growth model, the Gompertz growth model, and a logistic growth model. Males and females exhibited statistically significant differences in growth, indicating that females grow slower and attain larger sizes than males. Growth parameter estimates revealed slower growth rates than previously estimated (based on captive specimens) for Hawaiian sandbar sharks. The von Bertalanffy growth model using empirical length-at-birth provided the best biological and statistical fit to the data. This model gave parameter estimates of L ��P = 138.5 cm PCL and k = 0.12 year−1 for males and L ��P = 152.8 cm PCL, k = 0.10 year−1 for females.

Embryonic mortality was high (0-+783–0-+896 per annum) with the majority (99-+2\%) resulting from predation. The crested horn shark Heterodontus galeatus and common tent shell Astralium tentoriformis (Gastropoda, Turbinidae) were positively identified as egg predators. Gastropod predation was insignificant, accounting for only 2-+0 and 2-+1\% of total mortality at Terrigal Haven and Dent Rock, respectively. Most capsules appeared to have been depredated by large predatory fishes with the eastern blue groper Achoerodus viridis (Labridae) and the black stingray Dasyatis thetidis (Dasyatidae) as possible candidate predators. The rate of embryonic mortality in H. portusjacksoni is higher than that reported for other oviparous elasmobranchs.

	abstract = {Over-exploitation of whale sharks threatens the future of these wide-ranging pelagic fish. A long-term continuous record (4436 sightings) from a large aggregation (300-500 resident individuals) of whale sharks at Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia shows that mean shark length declined linearly by nearly 2.0�m and relative abundance measured from ecotourism sightings (corrected for variation in search effort and environmental stochasticity) has fallen by approximately 40\% over the last decade. This population-level result confirms previous predictions of population decline based on projection models parameterised using mark-recapture estimates of survival. The majority of these changes are driven by reductions in the number of large individuals in the population. Phenomenological time series models support a deterministic (extrinsic) decline in large females, although there was some evidence for density dependence in large males. These reductions have occurred despite the total protection of whale sharks in Australian waters. As this species is highly migratory, the rapid change in population composition over a decade ({\textless}1 whale shark generation) supports the hypothesis of unsustainable mortality in other parts of their range (e.g., overfishing), rather than the alternative of long-term abiotic or biotic shifts in the environment. As such, effective conservation of whale sharks will require international protection, and collaborative tagging studies to identify and monitor migratory pathways},

The status of this stock is ambiguous at a time when catch appears to be on the rise and new trade and exploitation patterns are emerging. This research provides fishery-independent demographic and risk analysis results for use in conservation and management. An age-structured matrix population model in which the vital rates are stochastic was constructed. A mean finite rate of population increase (++) of 1.23 year–1 and a mean population doubling time (t2) of 3.08 years suggests that the blue shark is one of the most productive shark species. However, this concept of high productivity could be misleading because an elasticity analysis shows a strong dependence of the population growth rate on the survival of juveniles (0–4 years). An analysis of the risk that the harvested population will decline to levels below an assumed threshold of 50\% of pre-exploited levels was conducted. The risk analysis is proposed as a supplement to the data-limited stock assessment, to better evaluate the probability that a given management strategy will put the population at risk of decline},

The majority of fish were recaptured within 50 km of where they were tagged, although there was an indication that fish that were at large longer moved further. The maximum distance moved was 3000 km and the maximum time at liberty was 1742 days. Quantitative analyses of life-history parameters from data collected in cooperative tagging programmes are generally not possible because there are usually no estimates of fishing effort, tag-related mortality and tag loss. These are likely to vary not only along the coast, but also among taggers. Cooperative tagging programmes provide some useful biological data (e.g.movement from point x to point y , and growth), but dedicated tagging programmes may be needed for estimates of other life-history parameters (e.g.mortality) and of abundance.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Nineteen C. leucas and five N. brevirostris were monitored during 2003 and 2004. Individual C. leucas were present for 8 to 89 days, while N. brevirostris were present for 12 to 83 days. Weekly minimum convex polygons and kernel utilisation distributions were calculated to demonstrate the home range and core areas of use of both species. Spectral analysis demonstrated that several N. brevirostris showed repetitive diel north–south movement patterns over periods of up to 28 consecutive days. C. leucas demonstrated regular use of backwater habitats. Long-term use of estuarine areas by these large juvenile sharks suggests that estuarine coastal lagoons provide an important habitat for this portion of their life history and as such, protection of these habitats may assist in shark management and conservation},

Both calcified structures presented observable growth bands, allowing cross comparison among structures for the first time in a shark species. Whole and sectioned vertebrae and dorsal fin-spines possess highly visible growth bands and intra-reader band counts resulted in similar precision indices with little systematic bias. However, inter-reader growth band count plots showed possible biases in counts from sectioned vertebrae and sectioned dorsal-fin spines. Sectioned vertebrae and whole and sectioned dorsal-fin spines produced similar growth band counts, whereas whole vertebrae produced significantly lower counts. The similar readability, precision indices, growth band counts and apparent absence of biases between counts for a single reader would indicate that sectioned vertebrae and whole and sectioned dorsal-fin spines are both potentially useful and acceptable methods for band counting. However, inter-reader comparisons are necessary to avoid acceptance of biased estimations, resulting in over- or under-estimations of age.

We evaluated the estimability of M using simulation analyses based on 12 groundfish stock assessments conducted using Stock Synthesis. The advantages of utilizing this set of peer-reviewed assessment models were that various types of data were used over a wide range of model parameterization.

These data were analysed to determine whether the distribution of CPUE is sufficiently heterogeneous in time and space that such measures might provide meaningful management alternatives. The resulting distributions of catch rates were also contrasted with monthly average sea surface temperatures to examine the possible association between temperature and CPUE. The results show spatio-temporal heterogeneity in catch rates that may be partly explained by seasonal changes in sea surface temperatures. The time\&\#8211;area concentrations of high CPUE differ between the species.

	abstract = {This paper provides a personal perspective on the future of ecosystem based fisheries management (EBFM). I begin with the question, "if we did single species management well, would EBFM be necessary." The answer to this is yes, because pure single-species management does not consider impacts on non-target species, trophic interactions among species, and habitat-destroying fishing practices. Pure single-species management conflicts with a range of legislation designed to protect non-target species and habitats within the U.S. and a number of other countries. The most important elements of EBFM are keeping fishing mortality rates low enough to prevent ecosystem-wide overfishing, reducing or eliminating by-catch and avoiding habitat-destroying fishing methods. There is a second phase of EBFM I call "extended EBFM" that consists of considering trophic interactions and area-based management. While there are now models of the trophic interactions for most highly managed ecosystems, and there are area-based management efforts underway in many places, I am not convinced that we are really ready, scientifically and administratively, to apply these forms of EBFM, because they are expensive and require complex trade-offs that are often ill-defined},

	abstract = {Construction of annual indices of stock abundance based on catch and effort data remains central to many fisheries' assessments. While the use of more advanced statistical methods has helped catch rates to be standardised against many explanatory variables, the changing spatial characteristics of most fisheries data sets provide additional challenges for constructing reliable indices of stock abundance. After reviewing the use of general linear models to construct indices of annual stock abundance, potential biases which can arise due to the unequal and changing nature of the spatial distribution of fishing effort are examined and illustrated through the analysis of simulated data. Finally, some options are suggested for modelling catch rates in unfished strata and for accounting for the uncertainties in the stock and fishery dynamics which arise in the interpretation of spatially varying catch rate data},

Schools of fish and individual fishing vessels are represented with artificial neural networks. These representations are intended to model behaviour decisions of movement in space.

Two scenarios are considered: one with no fishing regulation and another with area closure during the last quarter of the year. This model is focused on spatial dynamics of fishing effort. Effort redistribution when regulations are implemented is not well understood and this modelling approach can help fishery managers to envisage some regulation effects in the fishery},

Biological data from published studies in the Gulf of Mexico collected during the period 1979\&\#8211;1984 were compared with data collected during the period 1998\&\#8211;2001. For combined sexes, the von Bertalanffy growth parameters were \textit{L}$_{\textrm{\&\#8734;}}$ = 110.8 cm total length, \textit{K} = 0.39 year$^{\textrm{\&\#8211;1}}$ and \textit{t}$_{\textrm{o}}$ = \&\#8211;0.86 year during 1984 and \textit{L}$_{\textrm{\&\#8734;}}$ = 94.0 cm total length, \textit{K} = 0.73 year$^{\textrm{\&\#8211;1}}$ and \textit{t}$_{\textrm{o}}$ = \&\#8211;0.88 year during 1998\&\#8211;2001. Median size for males and females at maturity decreased from approximately 78.3 and 80.2-�cm total length (TL), respectively, in 1979\&\#8211;1980 to 72.6 and 75.8 cm TL, respectively, in 1998\&\#8211;2001. Age at maturity for combined sexes also decreased from 2.3 years in 1979\&\#8211;1980 to 1.4 years in 1998\&\#8211;2001. Litter size was similar between periods (5.0 embryos), as was the average size of embryos close to parturition (32 cm TL; 130\&\#8211;150-�g). Growth rates using observed mean size-at-age data were higher from 1998\&\#8211;2001 for early ages (0\&\#8211;2.5 years). The observed decrease in maturity and increased growth rate lends support to the hypothesis of a compensatory response, although it could not be fully determined whether the response was due to differences in methodology among studies, anthropogenic influences or natural causes. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Marine reserves are the primary management tool for Guam’s reef fish fishery. While a build-up of fish biomass has occurred inside reserve boundaries, it is unknown whether reserve size matches the scale of movement of target species. Using passive acoustic telemetry, we quantified movement patterns and home range size of two heavily exploited unicornfish Naso unicornis and Naso lituratus. Fifteen fish ( N. unicornis : n = 7; N. lituratus : n = 4 male, n = 4 female) were fitted with internal acoustic tags and tracked continuously over four months within a remote acoustic receiver array located in a decade-old marine reserve. This approach provided robust estimates of unicornfish movement patterns and home range size. The mean home range of 3.2 ha for N. unicornis was almost ten times larger than that previously recorded from a three-week tracking study of the species in Hawaii. While N. lituratus were smaller in body size, their mean home range (6.8 ha) was over twice that of N. unicornis . Both species displayed strong site fidelity, particularly during nocturnal and crepuscular periods. Although there was some overlap, individual movement patterns and home range size were highly variable within species and between sexes. N. unicornis home range increased with body size, and only the three largest fish home ranges extended into the deeper outer reef slope beyond the shallow reef flat. Both Naso species favoured habitat dominated by corals. Some individuals made predictable daily crepuscular migrations between different locations or habitat types. There was no evidence of significant spillover from the marine reserve into adjacent fished areas. Strong site fidelity coupled with negligible spillover suggests that small-scale reserves, with natural habitat boundaries to emigration, are effective in protecting localized unicornfish populations},

	abstract = {The relationship between body weight and natural mortality in juvenile and adult fish was analysed for different aquatic ecosystems: lakes, rivers, the ocean, and pond, cage and tank aquaculture systems. Mortality was modelled as a power function of weight, and the parameters b (exponent) and Mu (mortality at the unit weight of 1 g) estimated for fish in the six ecosystems, as well as within selected populations, species and families. At the ecosystem level, no significant differences in parameters were found between lakes, rivers and the ocean and a joint mortality-weight relationship for all natural ecosystems was estimated with parameters b=−0.288 (90\% CL[−0.315, −0.261]) and Mu=3.00 (90\% CL[2.70, 3.30]) year−1. Among the culture systems, mortality-weight relationships in ponds and cages were not significantly different and a joint relationship was estimated. The weight exponents of mortality in ponds/cages and tanks were very similar at about b=−0.43, and significantly more negative than in natural ecosystems. Mortalities at unit weight were significantly lower in tanks (0.91 year−1) than in ponds/cages (2.24 year−1), and both were significantly lower than in natural ecosystems. No systematic differences were found between the mortality-weight relationships determined for individual populations, species or families, and fish in the respective ecosystems. It is hypothesized that aquaculture mortality-weight relationships indicate the allometric scaling of non-predation mortality, which is therefore more strongly size dependent than predation mortality. If non predation mortality in natural ecosystems shows a similar scaling with body weight, then the allometric exponent of predation mortality must be less negative than that observed for total natural mortality. Implications of the established mortality-weight relationships for aquaculture and culture-based fisheries are discussed},

	abstract = {The common thresher shark, Alopias vulpinus, is the basis of the largest commercial shark fishery in California waters. We used acoustic telemetry to determine the diel movement patterns and habitat preferences of this species in the Southern California Bight (SCB), where commercial fishing for the common thresher shark is concentrated. Eight common threshers (fork length: 122–203-�cm) were tagged with temperature and depth-sensing acoustic transmitters and tracked for periods ranging from 22 to 49-�h. Tracked sharks preferentially utilized deep offshore waters, and avoided shallower waters over the continental shelf. Mean rate of movement (ROM-�-�-�s.d.) was 2.15-�-�-�0.46-�km-�h-1. ROM and angular concentration (r, a measure of relative linearity) both showed a strong daytime pattern, with highest values at dawn that decreased throughout the day, whereas nocturnal ROM and r were less variable. Daytime vertical movements consisted of either vertical excursions below the thermocline or relatively level swimming within the upper portion of the thermocline. Nocturnally, all sharks remained within the mixed layer. These findings suggest that the common thresher shark is primarily a daytime predator, and have relevance for estimating how the alteration of the set depth of fishing-gear could affect catch rates of this species in the SCB},

	abstract = {The seasonal temporal sexual segregation of white sharks Carcharodon carcharias, at the Neptune Islands, South Australia, is described in relation to environmental variables. A significant sexual segregation was found at this site with sex ratios strongly favouring males overall. Males were more prevalent than females in all months in a 3 year sampling period, aside from April and May. There was a significant difference between the sexes in terms of mean daily numbers over the months of the study. It was also observed that sexual segregation fluctuated for unknown reasons on a temporal scale. Predictive models for estimating male and female numbers based on a series of abiotic factors were generated. Sea surface temperature, tidal height, tidal range, moon phase, cloud cover, underwater visibility and swell height were related to daily sightings of male and female white sharks to determine the influence of these variables on sexual segregation. Visibility and sea surface temperature affected male numbers, however, visibility did not affect sexual segregation. Tidal height was significantly different between males and females. Sea surface temperature also appeared to be related to sexual segregation in this species. Females were present when temperatures ranged from 15-+7 to 18-+1-� C whereas males were observed at temperatures ranging from 14-+3 to 17-+8-� C, with a peak in sightings in September, when sea surface temperatures were at their lowest. Since parturition is thought to occur in spring or summer, it is suggested that females are absent at this time and only return during prime feeding periods or times at which temperatures are elevated in order to increase developmental growth rates of their young. The significantly lower temperatures in 2003 may explain the absence of females in this year. Hypotheses related to temperature regulation in this species are put forward to explain the sexual segregation observed},

Among the 21 Prionace glauca recaptured the l ongest time at liberty was 10.7 years, and seven sharks moved distances between 4362 and 7176 km. One shark tagged in south-west England was recaptured in the South Atlantic off South America. An Isurus oxyrinchus was at liberty for 4\&\#8211;6 years and a Lamna nasus for up to about 13 years. Lamna nasus were recaptured from northern Norway to northern Spain. The growth rates of the tagged sharks were close to the predicted values for G. galeus, were slower for P. glauca and faster for L. nasus},

On average 20,000 jigged mackerel have been tagged annually with internal steel tags in the spawning area west of Ireland and the British Isles, and the tags have been recaptured in commercial catches screened through metal detectors. The spawning stock biomass estimates derived from two different tag-based models were highly variable but were on average 2 and 2.3 times higher than the ICES official estimate. The official estimate is considered uncertain and most likely an underestimate of the actual biomass, due to unregistered mortality in the fisheries and lack of fishery-independent, age-disaggregated data. Hence, tag-based estimates could potentially improve the current assessment if included in the ICES stock assessment on a regular basis. These estimates also involve some uncertainty that needs consideration, especially related to variable tagging mortality, detector efficiency and migrations of the stock},

	abstract = {Fishery-independent surveys are an important source of information for stock assessment and management worldwide. Research surveys often use trawl gear to capture commercially valuable species and calculate indices of relative abundance or density. However, many species of interest do not occur in direct contact with the bottom, or occur in areas where high-relief habitat precludes trawl operation. This paper introduces a standardized hook and line survey for rockfish conducted by NOAA Fisheries' Northwest Fisheries Science Center in the Southern California Bight. The survey uses fishing gear similar to that used in many recreational fisheries to sample approximately 120 locations covering a wide range of depths and habitats. To provide an example of how these data can be analyzed for direct inclusion in stock assessments, we standardize catch rates of bocaccio rockfish from 2004-2008 using a Bayesian Generalized Linear Model to account for site, fishing time, survey vessel, angler, and other statistically significant effects. Results indicate that the bocaccio stock vulnerable to this survey in the Southern California Bight has shown a relatively flat trend over recent years. Length frequency distributions indicate the presence of several strong cohorts that should be detectable in future stock assessments of bocaccio for use in U.S. West Coast groundfish management. This survey is the only available tuning index for the adult portion of the bocaccio population in recent years as historically used recreational catch per unit effort indices have been compromised due to changes in bag limits and other management restrictions},

Free-swimming male \textit{M. mustelus} measured 390–1 450 mm total length (\textit{TL}), whereas females were recorded up to 1 650 mm \textit{TL}. Most specimens of both sexes were found at depths shallower than 100 m. Males mature at 950–1 300 mm \textit{TL} and females at 1 250–1 400 mm \textit{TL}. Reproduction is seasonal, and each cycle may take one year or longer, if there is a resting period between pregnancies. Litter size was correlated with female size and varied between 2 and 23. The largest embryo measured 425 mm \textit{TL}. The hepatosomatic indices were negatively correlated to embryo length in both species. Prey was dominated by crustaceans, although cephalopods became important in larger \textit{M. mustelus}. There was a good relationship between prey size and fish size. Free swimming mal+� \textit{M. palumbes} measured 275–1 008 mm \textit{TL}, whereas females were recorded up to 1 126 mm \textit{TL. M. palumbes} males were most often taken from 100–180 m deep and females from 60–140 m. Males mature at 750–850 mm \textit{TL} and females at 800–100 mm \textit{TL}. Reproduction appears to be aseasonal in \textit{M. palumbes} and litters of 3–15 young were recorded, with larger females having larger litters. The largest embryo recorded measured 340 mm \textit{TL}. The timing of reproductive cycles could not be established, but a high proportion of non-pregnant females suggests that there may be a resting period following pregnancy. Crustaceans were the dominant prey type recorded, although larger pr+�dators ate a wider variety of prey types than smaller individuals. Although there was overlap in the prey taken by the two shark species, the composition of the diet was strongly influenced by the prey available in different habitats},

Male gonads were symmetrical in terms of mass and both functional, whereas in females only the right ovary was functional. The seasonal changes in the oocytes and testes development, embryo length and the occurrence of near-term and post-partum females showed that this species displayed a clearly defined annual reproductive cycle with parturition occurring during late April and early May, after a gestation period of 10–11 months. Mating took place during May and early June and fertilization occurred from early June to early July. The embryo sex ratio was not significantly different from unity.

	abstract = {Maturity and growth characteristics were estimated for Dasyatis dipterura from western Mexico, where it is a common component of artisanal elasmobranch fisheries. Median disc width at maturity was estimated as 57.3 cm for females (n = 126) and 46.5 cm for males (n = 55) respectively. Age estimates were obtained from 304 fishery-derived specimens (169 female, 135 male). An annual pattern of band-pair deposition was validated through modified centrum edge and marginal increment analyses. Gompertz, polynomial and von Bertalanffy growth models were fit to disc width and weight-at-age data. Resulting models were evaluated based on biological rationale, standard error of model estimates, and Akaike’s information criteria. Growth characteristics differed significantly between females and males. Maximum age estimates were 28 years for females and 19 years for males. Three-parameter von Bertalanffy growth models of disc width-at-age data generated the most appropriate fits and produced relatively low estimates of instantaneous growth rates for females (DW��P = 92.4 cm, k = 0.05, t0 = –7.61, DW0 = 31.4 cm) and males (DW��P = 62.2 cm, k = 0.10, t0 = –6.80, DW0 = 31.3 cm). These values are the lowest reported for myliobatiform stingrays and indicate slow growth rates in comparison with elasmobranchs in general},

	abstract = {* 1.Fishing spans all oceans and the impact on ocean predators such as sharks and rays is largely unknown. A lack of data and complicated jurisdictional issues present particular challenges for assessing and conserving high seas biodiversity. It is clear, however, that pelagic sharks and rays of the open ocean are subject to high and often unrestricted levels of mortality from bycatch and targeted fisheries for their meat and valuable fins. * 2.These species exhibit a wide range of life-history characteristics, but many have relatively low productivity and consequently relatively high intrinsic vulnerability to over-exploitation. The IUCN — World Conservation Union Red List criteria were used to assess the global status of 21 oceanic pelagic shark and ray species. * 3.Three-quarters (16) of these species are classified as Threatened or Near Threatened. Eleven species are globally threatened with higher risk of extinction: the giant devilray is Endangered, ten sharks are Vulnerable and a further five species are Near Threatened. Threat status depends on the interaction between the demographic resilience of the species and intensity of fisheries exploitation. * 4.4. Most threatened species, like the shortfin mako shark, have low population increase rates and suffer high fishing mortality throughout their range. Species with a lower risk of extinction have either fast, resilient life histories (e.g. pelagic stingray) or are species with slow, less resilient life histories but subject to fisheries management (e.g. salmon shark). * 5.5. Recommendations, including implementing and enforcing finning bans and catch limits, are made to guide effective conservation and management of these sharks and rays.

	abstract = {The tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier Peron and Lesueur 1822) is a widely distributed predator with a broad diet and the potential to affect marine community structure, yet information on local patterns of abundance for this species is lacking. Tiger shark catch data were gathered over 7-�years of tag and release research fishing (1991–2000, 2002–2004) in Shark Bay, Western Australia (25-�45���S, 113-�44���E). Sharks were caught using drumlines deployed in six permanent zones ({\textasciitilde}3-�km2 in area). Fishing effort was standardized across days and months, and catch rates on hooks were expressed as the number of sharks caught h−1. A total of 449 individual tiger sharks was captured; 29 were recaptured. Tiger shark catch rate showed seasonal periodicity, being higher during the warm season (Sep–May) than during the cold season (Jun–Aug), and was marked by inter-annual variability. The most striking feature of the catch data was a consistent pattern of slow, continuous variation within each year from a peak during the height of the warm season (February) to a trough in the cold season (July). Annual growth rates of recaptured individuals were generally consistent with estimates from other regions, but exceeded those for populations elsewhere for sharks \&gt;275-�cm fork length (FL), perhaps because mature sharks in the study area rely heavily on large prey. The data suggest that (1) the threat of predation faced by animals consumed by tiger sharks fluctuates dramatically within and between years, and (2) efforts to monitor large shark abundance should be extensive enough to detect inter-annual variation and sufficiently intensive to account for intra-annual trends},

	abstract = {The biology of Urolophus paucimaculatus in south-western Australian waters has been examined and compared with that of the co-occurring Urolophus lobatus, Trygonoptera personata and Trygonoptera mucosa. These four species represent the only two genera of the Urolophidae. Urolophus paucimaculatus conceives in early/mid-summer and gives birth in late spring/early summer, closely paralleling the situation with U. lobatus. Although Trygonoptera species likewise have a 10–12-month gestation period, they conceive and give birth in late autumn to mid-winter. The marked intergeneric differences in birth time help account for pronounced intergeneric differences in the diets of their newly born young. By birth, Urolophus paucimaculatus attains  ̃50\% of its asymptotic size. The relatively large mean disc width of the four urolophids at birth, i.e. 105–128 mm, accounts for the small litters of these species (1–2 young per litter). Size at maturity and maximal size and age of each species are greater for females than males and are greater for Trygonoptera than Urolophus species. The growth of U. paucimaculatus and the other urolophids throughout pre- and postnatal life can be described by a single smooth growth curve. The maintenance of a constant pattern of growth from conception is remarkable because the diet and behaviour of these elasmobranchs changes radically at parturition},

	abstract = {Satellite-linked radio telemetry was used to study the geographic movements and vertical movement behaviour of the Pacific sleeper shark Somniosus pacificus. The fish were tagged near Steller sea lion Eumetopias jubatus rookeries in the Gulf of Alaska during periods when Steller sea lions pups were most vulnerable to predation; when Steller sea lion pups first enter the water (July to August) and when Steller sea lion pups are weaned (April to May). Final locations recovered from most Pacific sleeper sharks (76\%) were within 100 km of release locations, 16\% were within 100–250 km and 8\% were within 250–500 km. The most striking behavioural feature was their extensive, nearly continuous vertical movements. Median daily depth range was 184 m; the most time (61\%) was spent between 150 and 450 m, but ascents above 100 m were common (58\% of days). Median vertical movement rate was 6 km day−1 and steady. The longest period of continuous vertical movement ({\textgreater}-�60 m h−1) was 330 h. Systematic vertical oscillations were most common (60\%), followed by diel vertical migrations (25\%) and irregular vertical movements (15\%). The Pacific sleeper sharks travelled below the photic zone during the day and approached the surface at night. Pacific sleeper sharks appear to employ a stealth and ambush hunting strategy that incorporates slow vertical oscillations to search for prey, and cryptic colouration and cover of darkness to avoid detection by potential prey. The depth and geographic range of Pacific sleeper shark and Steller sea lions overlap near four important Steller sea lion rookeries in the northern Gulf of Alaska, so the potential exists for predation to occur. None of the tissues in the stomachs of the 198 Pacific sleeper sharks collected during a companion diet study, however, were identified as Steller sea lion},

	abstract = {Mark–recapture models for estimating survival and detection probabilities of tagged animals that migrate past successive receiver stations can incorporate multiple, linked stocks to improve detection probability estimates. When multiple release groups are analysed in a common framework, detection information can be shared to compensate for small sample sizes and provide generality beyond single-stock approaches. Methods for structuring complex detection history data and applying standard mark–recapture models are presented, allowing for information sharing among multiple stocks under nested migration route structures, where some portions of routes are shared with other stocks and other portions are unique. Possible biases from split-route migration patterns within a release group are described, along with a simple method of correcting these biases using stock-specific parameters that incorporate movement probabilities. Environmental covariates can be paired with stock-specific run timing data to model stock-specific detection probabilities that change seasonally. Finally, a method for assessing the redundancy of receivers on a multiple-receiver detection line is described, based on considerations of receiver line geometry. Examples are drawn from detection data of juvenile salmon on the Pacific Ocean Shelf Tracking Project (POST) array, but the methods presented here are transferable to other systems},

	abstract = {Abstract Pop-up satellite archival tags (PSATs) are now widely used to document the geographic and vertical movements of large pelagic fishes. These instruments record measurements of ambient light, depth and temperature at regular intervals and the light data are used to compute daily estimates of latitude and longitude. Several methods have been developed to improve those estimates, including the application of Kalman filter models and matching sea surface temperatures (SST) from tags with remotely sensed SSTs. Despite their widespread use, few studies have evaluated the accuracy of raw estimates of location from PSATs or quantified the improvements that may result from refinement techniques. To assess the accuracy of raw and refined estimates of locations from PSATs, we attached two PSATs and one Argos satellite-linked transmitter (SAT tag) to one whale shark (Rhincodon typus) at Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia. The root mean square error (RMSE) in raw estimates of location provided by the PSATs was 5.16-� latitude and 2.00-� longitude. Estimates were more accurate after processing the data with a Kalman filter (RMSE-�=-�2.97-� latitude and 0.78-� longitude) and most accurate after processing with a Kalman filter model that integrates SST measurements (RMSE-�=-�1.84-� latitude and 0.78-� longitude). We also assessed the precision of the PSAT-derived locations, and depth and temperature measurements by comparing the data from the two PSATs. Our findings support the use of archival tag data to reconstruct the large-scale movements of marine animals and demonstrate the significant improvements that may result from two refinement techniques},

	abstract = {A substantial shift toward use of marine protected areas (MPAs) for conservation and fisheries management is currently underway. This shift to explicit spatial management presents new challenges and uncertainties for ecologists and resource managers. In particular, the potential for MPAs to change population sustainability, fishery yield, and ecosystem properties depends on the poorly understood consequences of three critical forms of connectivity over space: larval dispersal, juvenile and adult swimming, and movement of fishermen. Conventional fishery management describes the dynamics and current status of fish populations, with increasing recent emphasis on sustainability, often through reference points that reflect individual replacement. These compare lifetime egg production (LEP) to a critical replacement threshold (CRT) whose value is uncertain. Sustainability of spatially distributed populations also depends on individual replacement, but through all possible paths created by larval dispersal and LEP at each location. Model calculations of spatial replacement considering larval connectivity alone indicate sustainability and yield depend on species dispersal distance and the distribution of LEP created by species habitat distribution and fishing mortality. Adding MPAs creates areas with high LEP, increasing sustainability, but not necessarily yield. Generally, short distance dispersers will persist in almost all MPAs, while sustainability of long distance dispersers requires a specific density of MPAs along the coast. The value of that density also depends on the uncertain CRT, as well as fishing rate. MPAs can increase yield in areas with previously low LEP but for short distance dispersers, high yields will require many small MPAs. The paucity of information on larval dispersal distances, especially in cases with strong advection, renders these projections uncertain. Adding juvenile and adult movement to these calculations reduces LEP near the edges in MPAs, if movement is within a home-range, but more broadly over space if movement is diffusive. Adding movement of fishermen shifts effort on the basis of anticipated revenues and fishing costs, leading to lower LEP near ports, for example. Our evolving understanding of connectivity in spatial management could form the basis for a new, spatially oriented replacement reference point for sustainability, with associated new uncertainties},

	abstract = {Atlantic cownose rays (Rhinoptera bonasus) are benthic, suction feeders whose foraging activities have been implicated in severe damage to commercial shellfish industries. With jaws highly modified for durophagy, it has been assumed that R. bonasus are crushing specialists that feed primarily upon hard molluscan prey. Stomach contents from R. bonasus caught within Florida’s Charlotte Harbor estuary between July 2003 and July 2004 were analysed using the index of relative importance (IRI) to determine most important prey types. Prey items were identified from 38 families and fell into nine distinctive groups. The three most dominant prey groups were crustaceans (\%IRI = 55.31), polychaetes (\%IRI = 25.20) and bivalves (\%IRI = 12.58). Shoalmates had more similar diets than non-shoalmates, suggesting group feeding. Most small or softer-bodied prey consumed were relatively intact, indicating lack of prey processing and capture through suction feeding. All larger, harder-bodied prey showed evidence of crushing (fractured and broken shells). Although R. bonasus has been characterised as a hard prey specialist, these results suggest it may behave as an opportunistic generalist, modifying feeding behaviour to consume readily available prey},

	abstract = {We used hold-out cross validation model selection to determine the most appropriate form of the selectivity curve, using a nonparametric approach to represent selectivity. The cross-validation method is based on setting aside a portion of the catch-at-age (or catch-at-length) data to use as a test data set. The remaining catch-at-age data, along with other data (e.g. relative indices of abundance) are used to estimate the parameters of the stock assessment model, including the selectivity parameters. These parameter estimates are then used to predict the catch at age for the test data set. The selectivity model that produces the closest predictions to the test data set is chosen as the selectivity model to use in the assessment. The selectivity model we use is nonparametric, based on estimating an individual selectivity parameter for each age and then applying smoothness penalties to constrain how much the selectivity can change from age to age. The smoothness penalties we consider are the first, second, and third differences, a length-based penalty, and a monotonic penalty. The penalties are applied on the logarithm of selectivity to avoid scale-related problems and improve stability. The method was applied to the assessment of bigeye tuna in the eastern Pacific Ocean. We found that the estimated management quantities were relatively robust within the set of smoothness penalties that gave low cross-validations scores. We also found that poor choices for the smoothness penalties could give very different results. Poor choices include both under-smoothing (e.g. no penalties) and over-smoothing (penalties that are too large). The most influential factor was the inclusion of a monotonic penalty},

	abstract = {The school shark (\textit{Galeorhinus galeus}) resource off southern Australia is assessed by use of an assessment approach that takes account of the spatial structure of the population. The population dynamics model underlying the assessment considers the spatial as well as the age-specific characteristics of school shark. It allows for a series of fisheries (each based on a different gear type), explicitly models the pupping/recruitment process, and allows for multiple stocks. The values for the parameters of this model are determined by fitting it to catch-rate data and information from tagging studies. The point estimates of the pup production at the start of 1997 range from 12\% to 18\% of the pre-exploitation equilibrium size, depending on the specifications of the assessment. Allowing for spatial structure and incorporating tag release\&\#8211;recapture data lead to reduced uncertainty compared with earlier assessments. The status of the resource, as reflected by the ratio of present to virgin pup production and total (1+) biomass, is sensitive to the assumed level of movement between the stocks in New Zealand and those in Australia, with lower values corresponding to higher levels of movement.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {In applying a quantitative approach to the reproduction of Trygonoptera imitata, the present study contributes to understanding the wide diversity in the reproductive biology of the family Urolophidae and provides insights to help determine phylogenetic relationships. This localised species is taken as bycatch in several inshore fisheries and potentially impacted by a range of other anthropogenic pressures, including introduced species, particularly in shallow-water pupping areas. T. imitata can be characterised as a species of comparatively low matrotrophic histotrophy with an extended period of relatively large eggs in utero (5–8 months) followed by rapid growth of the embryos (4–6 months). The reproductive cycle is annual with parturition occurring during late-February–April, followed immediately by ovulation. Mean size-at-birth is  ̃225 mm total length and there is a  ̃1000\% gain in mean wet mass from egg (15 g) to full-term embryo in utero (150 g), the lowest reported for any viviparous batoid. Litter size increases with maternal length, reaching a maximum of seven, and sex ratio of embryos is 1 : 1. Maximum length and estimates of the maturity–ogive parameters l50 and l95 are similar for females and males},

Between 2005 and 2007, we investigated the taxonomic group and wet weight of sessile multicellular eukaryonts growing on 33 B-type dart tags recaptured from raggedtooth sharks (Carcharias taurus Rafinesque, 1810) along the eastern coast of South Africa. All tags, except one from a shark that had been at liberty only for 13 days, contained some degree of macro-fouling that ranged from 0.031 to 7.687-�g wet weight. Barnacles and hydroids were the first colonisers and were recorded on tags after only 47 days. Bivalves, polychaetes and algae succeeded within 60 days. The last two taxa to be recorded were ascidians and sponges. There was no significant relationship between either the biomass of sessile organisms (P-�=-�0.17) or the number of taxa (P-�=-�0.59) found growing on tags and their time at liberty. Calcium carbonate plugs, ranging in weight from 0.16 to 9.18-�g, were found at the site of the tag insertion wound on 27.3\% of recaptures.

Unique physical marks (e.g. partial fin loss) on six wild sharks were used to validate the pattern recognition process by providing unambiguous identification of individuals independently of their spots.

Models suggest precipitous (76\%) declines in hammerhead (Sphyrna species) and large coastal (dusky, night, and silky shark, genus Carcharhinus) species, and moderate declines (53\%) in blue and oceanic whitetip sharks over this period. In contrast, mako and thresher sharks appear to have stabilized, and the tiger shark population appears to be increasing. A comparison of nominal shark catch rates from this fleet's observer and logbook data (to evaluate the veracity of trends previously estimated from the latter) showed a high degree of concordance for each species group, both in individual sub-areas and overall. Models of these two datasets for the common time period (1992-2000) show that compared to the observer data the logbook data indicate greater declines for some species, but lesser declines for others. Signs of recovery for some shark species are encouraging, but must also be set in the context of the significant declines that occurred in previous decades},

	abstract = {Understanding the movement and habitat use patterns of threatened species is essential to effective conservation planning. Modern tracking techniques such as active tracking and passive acoustic monitoring can be useful tools in elucidating this information for aquatic species. To aid in the development of conservation strategies for juvenile critically endangered smalltooth sawfish (Pristis pectinata) their fine scale movements and habitat use in southwest Florida were studied using a combination of these techniques. Between 2002 and 2006 a total of 12 individuals were actively tracked for periods of up to 24�h to provide detailed habitat use and movement parameters (distance moved, speed, and linearity). Smaller individuals ({\textless}100�cm stretched total length (STL)) had the smallest home ranges, low linearity of movement and had a preference for very shallow mud banks. Juveniles {\textgreater}100�cm STL demonstrated larger home ranges, preference for shallow mud or and sand banks, and remained close to mangrove shorelines. Tide was found to be the main factor influencing movement on short time scales. Sawfish {\textless}150�cm STL spend the majority of their time in water {\textless}50�cm, while larger juveniles spend most of their time in water 50-100�cm deep. From 2003 to 2007 a total of 22 individuals were fitted with acoustic tags for long-term monitoring. Juveniles {\textgreater}130�cm had high levels of site fidelity for specific nursery areas for periods up to almost 3�months, but the smaller juveniles had relatively short site fidelity to specific locations. The use of a combination of tracking and monitoring techniques provided an expanded range of information by generating both short and long term data on habitat use. The data demonstrated that the conservation of shallow mud and sand banks, and mangrove shorelines will benefit the recovery of these endangered elasmobranchs},

	abstract = {The school shark fishery in south-eastern Australian waters has operated on a homogeneous stock which has a low reproductive potential. The species is slow-growing; the smallest mature males (120 cm) are over 8 yr of age and the smallest mature females (135 cm) are at least 2 yr older. The gestation period is approximately 6 months and it is estimated that only about half the female population bear young each year. Each gravid female carries 17-41 young with a mean number of 28. The lengths of the normal full-term embryos range from 280 to 350 mm with a mean for both sexes of 300 mm. The larger females tend to have the longest embryos. Slightly more male than female young (54 : 46) are born. Because the inshore populations of juveniles have been dwindling and the size of the older stock is decreasing, it is believed that this slow-growing species is being overfished. Measures aimed at protecting school sharks in their vulnerable stages have been proposed. Any conservation programme will be long-term as this shark has such a low reproductive capacity},

	abstract = {Abstract Sharks fisheries have declined globally due to over- and unregulated fishing. As with many collapsed and unmonitored coastal fisheries, information is difficult to obtain, yet it is important to understand the historical changes determining population trends and evaluate the current status of sharks in order to conserve these vulnerable species. Here, we document for the first time the history and general condition of the shark fisheries of Southern China, specifically Hong Kong, and Guangdong, Fujian and Hainan Provinces. This study shows, through the use of historical literature and anecdotal accounts, including fisher interviews, that all known shark fisheries in the region collapsed between the 1970s and the 1990s. Of the 109 species present historically in the South China Sea, only 18 species were recorded in current market surveys, of which all were landed as bycatch and 65\% were below the size of sexual maturity. Markets are dominated by smaller species, including the spadenose shark (Scoliodon laticaudus) and the whitespotted bambooshark (Chiloscyllium plagiosum). Marketed large shark species are almost all below the size of sexual maturation, evidence of growth overfishing and a factor in recruitment overfishing. Some species, like the whale (Rhincodon typus) and basking sharks (Cetorhinus maximus), are clearly vulnerable to local extinction without intervention. Given the inherent vulnerability of sharks and the overfished states of many sharks, there is clearly an urgent need to formulate impacting conservation and management plans for these rapidly declining species in a region that has the highest demand for shark products globally},

	abstract = {The Atlantic sharpnose shark, Rhizoprionodon terraenovae, is the most abundant shark in the Gulf of Mexico. This species is captured with different fishing gears and is available throughout the year because of its coastal habits. A demographic analysis incorporating biological data on reproduction, age at maturity (imat), fecundity, maximum age (imax), sex ratio (1:1) and natural mortality at specific ages (M) was carried out. Previously described age and growth data of individuals from the northern Gulf of Mexico were used. The variability of the environment and the high level of fishing pressure prompted us to assume that M decreased because of potential density-dependent effects. A first run under non-exploitation conditions, incorporating the input parameters imat=4, imax=10, and M iterating randomly (uniform) from 0.42 to 0.378, yielded a reproductive rate (R0) from 1.12 to 1.44, a generation time (G) from 5.8 to 5.9 years and an intrinsic rate of increase (r) between 0.021 and 0.062. The final run was with estimates of fishing mortality added (based on F=0.46 from a Leslie-DeLury analysis, which considered catch, effort and catch per effort data and a constant catchability coefficient (q) from an assumed relatively homogeneous artisanal fleet). Trial results by varying F and age at first capture (ifc) showed that the combination of ifc=4 and F=0.1 yielded a positive R0 value of 1.07, which indicates that R. terraenovae is very vulnerable to fishing pressure. Thus, the empirical knowledge of the fishery and current F and ifc situation appears consistent with an eventually declining population, and the fishery may be at risk of future collapse. These first results will allow us to establish the strategies necessary to manage this fishery},

	abstract = {Summary The world's second largest fish, the basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus), is broadly distributed in boreal to warm temperate latitudes of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans from shallow coastal waters to the open ocean [1] and [2]. Previous satellite archival tagging in the North Atlantic has shown that basking sharks move seasonally, are often associated with productive frontal zones [3] and [4], and may make occasional dives to mesopelagic depths [3] and [5]. However, basking sharks are thought to be restricted to temperate latitudes, and the extent to which they exploit deeper-water habitat remains enigmatic. Via satellite archival tags and a novel geolocation technique, we demonstrate here that basking sharks are seasonal migrants to mesopelagic tropical waters. Tagged sharks moved from temperate feeding areas off the coast of southern New England to the Bahamas, the Caribbean Sea, and onward to the coast of South America and into the Southern Hemisphere. When in these areas, basking sharks descended to mesopelagic depths and in some cases remained there for weeks to months at a time. Our results demonstrate that tropical waters are not a barrier to migratory connectivity for basking shark populations and highlight the need for global conservation efforts throughout the species range},

By assuming that movement is a correlated random walk, we derive a formula that relates expected square displacements to the number of consecutive moves. We show this displacement formula can be used to highlight the consequences of different searching behaviors (i.e. different probability distributions of turning angles or move lengths). Observations of Pieris rapae (cabbage white butterfly) flight and Battus philenor (pipe-vine swallowtail) crawling are analyzed as a correlated random walk. The formula that we derive aptly predicts that net displacements of ovipositing cabbage white butterflies. In other circumstances, however, net displacements are not well-described by our correlated random walk formula; in these examples movement must represent a more complicated process than a simple correlated random walk. We suggest that progress might be made by analyzing these more complicated cases in terms of higher order markov processes},

Hence, the long-term effects of surgically implanted acoustic telemetry transmitters on survival, tag retention, healing and growth on Pomatomus saltatrix (known as tailor in Australia, elf in South Africa and bluefish in North America) were studied over 144 days. P. saltatrix are well suited for transmitter implants because no tagging-related short- or long-term mortality or transmitter expulsion was recorded. Small transmitters (9 +� 28 mm, 3.3 g in water) did not affect the specific growth rate of tagged fish compared with an untagged control group. In contrast, the fish tagged with large transmitters (13 +� 50 mm, 6.9 g in water) had a reduced specific growth rate. The small, but not the large transmitter, seemed suitable for tagging P. saltatrix of the body sizes represented in this study (215–621 g). The specific growth rate was negatively affected by increasing the transmitter-mass-in-water to body-mass ratio. It is recommended that this ratio should not exceed 1.4\%},

An array of passive acoustic receivers was utilised to track the movements of 64 neonate and juvenile sandbar sharks within the Eastern Shore of Virginia summer nursery during the summers of 2003–2005. Residency patterns were variable during each year of the study, with younger sandbar sharks spending more time within the array area than older sharks. The number of detections was positively related to the distance of the receiver inshore from the inlet, indicating that young sandbar sharks preferentially utilise protected, shallow near-shore waters. Neonate and juvenile sandbar sharks tended to be detected more frequently within all areas of the inlet at slack tides, during the night and during early dawn hours. Periodogram analyses indicated that juvenile sharks tend to move in the direction of tidal currents. The present study documents large- and small-scale movement patterns of juvenile sandbar sharks and emphasises the importance of nursery-area habitats for this species},

	abstract = {Shark feeding is widespread throughout tropical, subtropical and temperate marine ecosystems and gives rise to controversy because there is little consensus regarding its management. There are few comprehensive reports that consider how shark feeding with bait might impact local fishes, despite the development of this practice during the last few decades. Although shark feeding might theoretically have parasitological effects on local non-target fish species in the vicinity of feeding areas, this aspect has never been investigated. During an extensive parasitological survey conducted between 2005 and 2007, a total of 1117 fish belonging to six common grouper and snapper species were sampled throughout the entire north coast of Moorea Island (French Polynesia), encompassing three localities where feeding has occurred frequently since the 1990s. Parasites exhibited no spatial patterns except for the infections on the blacktip grouper (Epinephelus fasciatus). On this species, the prevalence of larval cestodes that parasitise sharks as adults and the intensity of their infestation were significantly higher around shark-feeding localities compared with non-shark-feeding localities. Our results suggest for the first time that although long-term shark feeding has parasitological implications, the impacts appear limited, only involve cestode larvae from one host species and do not seem to affect the health of the fish we studied},

	url = {http://icesjms.oxfordjournals.org/content/39/3/211.abstract},
	abstract = {A form of the log-linear model for modelling catch per unit effort (c.p.u.e.) is described which treats the year category as an ANOVA classification. This model allows the calculation of two standardized relative abundance indices: 1) direct interpretation of regression coefficients for the year category, and 2) the usual estimates of c.p.u.e. calculated using standardized effort (adjusted c.p.u.e.). The regression coefficient estimates have advantages in theoretical simplicity and computational convenience.The model is applied to two trawl-fished populations of Pacific ocean perch (Sebastes alutus) in the northeast Pacific. Catch and effort data from 1953 to 1976 were used to calculate relative abundance indices standardized for gross tonnage, echo sounders with paper recorders, and roller (bobbin) gear. Stock conditions for the two populations have been historically different, and this factor is shown to interact with the impact of technological improvements. In the Queen Charlotte Sound region, where stocks have been and remain in relatively good condition, technological improvements had little measurable effect on catch rates. However, in the west Vancouver Island region, where stocks have been smaller and are now depleted, these same technological improvements (echo sounders with paper recorders and roller gear) doubled the estimated efficiency of vessels.Due principally to catches by large Japanese and Soviet trawlers, relative abundance indices in both the Charlotte and Vancouver regions registered a sharp decline (50\% and greater) in 1965 to 1968. This decline was particularly severe in the Vancouver region. In the Charlotte region, relative abundance measured by regression coefficient estimates and adjusted c.p.u.e.s were nearly identical; but in the Vancouver region, these estimates differed. Considering the methods used in calculation, it was concluded that this difference was probably due to chance events rather than systematic bias.The use of a qualifying criterion for selecting data (deleting data for which the catch is below some fixed percentage of the study species) can greatly affect estimates of relative abundance in multi-species fisheries. In the Charlotte region, a qualifying percentage of 25 \% had little effect on relative abundance estimates. But for the Vancouver region, a qualifying percentage of 25 \% significantly lessened the estimated decline in abundance.In summary, it appears that there is generally an interaction between the effects of technological improvements in a fishing fleet and the condition of fish stocks. It appears that technological improvements sometimes have their greatest measurable impact on fully utilized or depleted stocks. Also, the selection of qualification levels will sometimes be critical when measuring large declines in stock abundance},

Serial serum samples from four mature female {\textless}I{\textgreater}Carcharhinus plumbeus{\textless}/I{\textgreater}, one maturing female {\textless}I{\textgreater}C. leucas{\textless}/I{\textgreater}, and one mature and one nearly mature female {\textless}I{\textgreater}Negaprion brevirostris{\textless}/I{\textgreater} were used to determine serum concentrations of 17+�-oestradiol, progesterone, testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. The data from these mature placental sharks were then compared with concentrations measured in immature female and male conspecifics and in mature female {\textless}I{\textgreater}Eugomphodus taurus{\textless}/I{\textgreater} (family Odontaspididae). Evidence of repetitive cyclical patterns was obtained from a mature female {\textless}I{\textgreater}N. brevirostris{\textless}/I{\textgreater}. This shark was monitored from June 1988 to July 1990 by means of more than 50 samples that were often obtained at weekly intervals. Concentrations of 17+�-oestradiol in the serum of this shark varied in a cyclical fashion, with the highest values obtained in Year 1 (1988-89) being during April (the normal mating season) and those in Year 2 (1989-90) being during June. Concomitant elevations of testosterone concentrations were observed either simultaneously or immediately before or after maximal oestradiol concentrations were noted. Progesterone concentrations were low except for definitive spikes that immediately preceded the maximal concentrations of testosterone and 17+�-oestradiol. These periodicities suggest, for placental sharks, that consistently rising oestradiol concentrations may set in motion preovulatory events, that testosterone may be important for the initiation of subsequent ovulatory events, and that transitory elevations of progesterone concentrations may have specific short-term roles. These cyclical changes in the concentrations of steroid hormones observed in captive elasmobranchs support observations of hormone concentrations during reproduction in wild carcharhinids.{\textless}/P{\textgreater}},

Many models have been developed, but experimental design problems have received little attention in the fisheries literature. This lack of a proper experimental design can severely compromise the accuracy and precision of the estimates of movement rates. In this paper, I develop a simple, individual-based, population dynamics model to account for fishing mortality, natural mortality, fish movement, tag shedding and differing reporting rates, derive a likelihood function for its parameter estimation, and use the population dynamics model and the estimation procedure to design a tagging program for the school shark Galeorhinus galeus. In the application, the minimum, mean, maximum, and three common norms of both relative bias and relative standard error of the estimates of all movement rates were each calculated as a function of the total number of fish released. From these calculations, one can readily determine the number of releases to achieve a certain level of precision and accuracy in the estimates of movement rates or vice versa},

The median half-life, a measure of residence time, of skipjack and yellowfin in WCPO exclusive economic zones (EEZs) is 3-6 months. Fishing decreases the lifetime displacement and decreases the half-life.

	abstract = {In 1998, the barndoor skate \textit{Dipturus laevis} was reported to have been locally extirpated in parts of its northern range and to be potentially on the brink of extinction. Managers were faced with assessing the species with virtually no information other than a limited number of individuals observed in annual groundfish surveys. Since that time, a number of the primary life history parameters have been estimated, but the population dynamics of the species remain largely unexplored. In this study, we use information from the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) annual groundfish surveys to investigate two critical components of barndoor skate population dynamics: the relationship of recruitment to spawner abundance and the maximum population growth rate. A strong stock–recruitment relationship was found in the fall survey data, suggesting that recruitment is closely tied to spawner abundance. The Ricker and Beverton–Holt stock–recruit models were fitted to the survey data, and estimates of the slope at the origin was generated. These parameters provided an estimate of the maximum annual reproductive rate, which was then converted to an estimate of the instantaneous maximum population growth rate of 0.37–0.38 per year. A second analysis was also conducted using a Leslie matrix and data from the NMFS survey. Observed rates of population change were used to estimate early life history parameters and incorporate density dependence into the density-independent framework of a Leslie matrix demographic model. From this method, the instantaneous maximum population growth for the barndoor skate was estimated to be 0.36–0.48 per year. Our results suggest that the species is more resilient to fishing pressure than previously believed and is capable of growing at an instantaneous rate in excess of 35\% at low population sizes},

	abstract = {This paper presents information on the movements of white sharks, Carcharodon carcharias, at the South Farallon Islands (SFI), central California. Acoustic telemetry techniques provided preliminary data on the diurnal space utilization, movement patterns and swimming depths of four white sharks, ranging from approximately 3.7 to 4.9m in length. Sharks swam within about 10m of the bottom to depths of approximately 30m, but in deeper water they tended to stray more from the bottom. Activity spaces for time periods tracked ranged from 1.84 to 9.15km 2 . Indications are that an inverse relationship exists between length and activity space. During the time tracked, larger individuals swam within particular areas around the islands whereas smaller individuals did not restrict their movements in the same manner. Values of a site attachment index were inversely related to length for all sharks tracked. The site attachment indices, apparent inverse relationship between total length and activity space and observations on telemetered and other known individuals support a hypothesis that larger sharks possess site fidelity in their search for prey at SFI, within and between years. With the high frequency of predation by white sharks on juvenile northern elephant seals at SFI in the fall, the majority of the sharks' movements are probably related to their search for these pinniped prey. These data provide preliminary evidence that white sharks at SFI may search for prey by swimming in a particular area over a number of days or weeks, traversing the area in a manner which maximizes coverage, and swimming close to the bottom or at a distance far enough from the surface to remain cryptic from prey},

	abstract = {Sharks possess anterior electrosensory pores (ampullae of Lorenzini), which allow them to detect very weak electromagnetic fields. Powerful magnetic fields may overwhelm this sense, and repel sharks, even in the presence of an attractant. Using underwater video, we tested seven rare earth magnet configurations, two ferrite magnet configurations and two rare earth electropositive metals as means to reduce the rate at which Galapagos sharks (Carcharhinus galapagensis) depredated baited lines. Configurations of three 50�mm diameter rare earth magnet discs showed the most potential, with a vertical configuration of magnets alongside the bait reducing depredation by 50\%, and a stacked configuration of the same magnets above the bait also producing significantly more aborted investigations of the bait prior to depredation. No other magnetic or electropositive metal configuration produced significant reductions in depredation rates, time taken to strike, or number of prior investigations. Our study showed that the overriding factor determining Galapagos shark behaviours towards baits was conspecific density. The number of sharks present increased as trials progressed, with a corresponding decrease in their time to depredate baits. This effect was particularly apparent when three or more animals were present. These higher shark densities diminished the effectiveness of our experiments as individuals engaged in non-selective "mob" rushes towards the closest bait. Although our results showed that social interactions between sharks outweighed individual responses to depredation-mitigation devices, magnetic deterrents have high potential for reducing shark bycatch for species that occur in lower densities, or which interact less vigorously with conspecifics than Galapagos sharks},

	abstract = {We used a combination of satellite telemetry, archival and conventional tags to show that white sharks made broad-scale movements consistent with mixing of the population across their entire Australasian range. The capture of one of these sharks in New Zealand, some 3,550-�km from the point of tagging in South Australia, provides further confirmation that white sharks sometimes move into open ocean waters and cross deep ocean basins. However, most movements were confined to shelf waters, generally in areas of less than 100-�m depth and in some cases into waters of less than 5-�m depth. Sharks showed considerable plasticity in swimming patterns, which included many of the behaviours reported for other species. One of the archival-tagged sharks showed separate periods of distinct swimming behaviour as it moved into different habitats and travelled between them. The changes in swimming behaviour were abrupt and suggested rapid switching of hunting strategies for different prey types in these habitats. All tracked sharks showed both prolonged periods of directional swimming in coastal waters at swimming speeds of 2–3-�km-�h−1 as well as temporary residency in particular regions. Movements of tagged white sharks, together with data from shark control programs and bycatch records, suggest a seasonal movement northward along the east coast of Australia during the autumn–winter months and south in spring–early summer. The consistency of paths taken by white sharks in Australian waters suggests that they may follow common routes or highways in some areas. If so, identifying such areas may assist in reducing interactions with fishing operations and thus reduce bycatch},

A method for evaluating the impacts of fishing mortality and stochastic influences on the demography of two long-lived shark stocks. — ICES Journal of Marine Science, 64.Stochastic demographic models were developed for Carcharhinus obscurus and C. plumbeus populations off the west coast of Australia by resampling the input parameters for life tables from empirical biological data collected from commercial target fisheries and fishery-independent surveys. The models were used to examine the effects of multiple scenarios of age-specific survival, derived from the fishing mortality rates estimated from a tagging study on sharks and indirect estimates of natural mortality. In the absence of fishing, median estimates of the rates of intrinsic population increase (r) were 0.025 for both species. Inclusion of the age-specific fishing mortality rates estimated for C. obscurus recruits born in 1994 and 1995 resulted in the median estimates of r declining to 0.007 and 0.012, respectively, suggesting that recent harvest levels of mainly neonates by the target fishery were probably sustainable. However, the model also suggested that the population was more susceptible to exploitation of older sharks than was previously believed. The C. plumbeus model indicated that fishing mortality between 2001 and 2004 was probably unsustainable. The increasingly negative trend in median r estimates (from –0.032 to –0.049), and the population’s apparently limited capacity for density-dependent compensation through changes in fecundity, somatic growth and longevity, suggests that management intervention is necessary to prevent continued stock depletion},

The diet, head morphology and dentition of Heterodontus portusjacksoni, an abundant, epibenthic shark in the coastal waters of temperate eastern Australia, were examined in 2004–2005. The stomach contents of the juvenile, subadult and adult stages of 136 males and 100 females were examined. Diets were broad (32 prey taxa), but dominated by molluscs, teleosts and cephalopods. Analyses of stomach contents data demonstrated that diet differed significantly by ontogenetic stage, but not by sex. Juveniles and subadults consumed mainly benthic infauna and epifauna, with subadults ingesting greater amounts of diogenid crustaceans, and adult diets dominated by demersal/pelagic prey. Trophic level differed ontogenetically, from secondary consumers as juveniles and subadults to tertiary consumers as adults. The mainly tricuspidate juvenile dentition changed with maturity to a greater proportion of large molariform distal teeth, whereas the snout and jaw lengthened and broadened. Adult males retained a greater proportion of anterior S-family teeth than females, which was most likely related to copulation. The ontogenetic variation in dietary composition, facilitated by differences in dentition and mouth morphology, demonstrated that dietary resources were partitioned ontogenetically},

	abstract = {Movements of wide-ranging top predators can now be studied effectively using satellite and archival telemetry. However, the motivations underlying movements remain difficult to determine because trajectories are seldom related to key biological gradients, such as changing prey distributions. Here, we use a dynamic prey landscape of zooplankton biomass in the north-east Atlantic Ocean to examine active habitat selection in the plankton-feeding basking shark Cetorhinus maximus. The relative success of shark searches across this landscape was examined by comparing prey biomass encountered by sharks with encounters by random-walk simulations of ‘model’ sharks. Movements of transmitter-tagged sharks monitored for 964 days (16 754 km estimated minimum distance) were concentrated on the European continental shelf in areas characterized by high seasonal productivity and complex prey distributions. We show movements by adult and sub-adult sharks yielded consistently higher prey encounter rates than 90\% of random-walk simulations. Behavioural patterns were consistent with basking sharks using search tactics structured across multiple scales to exploit the richest prey areas available in preferred habitats. Simple behavioural rules based on learned responses to previously encountered prey distributions may explain the high performances. This study highlights how dynamic prey landscapes enable active habitat selection in large predators to be investigated from a trophic perspective, an approach that may inform conservation by identifying critical habitat of vulnerable species},

T.-�scyllium changed their main food items from shrimps to echiuran worms then to cephalopods with their growth. Comparing food habits by the value of similarity (maximum = 1), the small-sized T.-�scyllium had a low value (0.17) compared to larger sharks. T.-�scyllium gradually increased the diversity of food until it reached 700-�mm long in total length, however, after that it decreased. H.-�japanica appeared mainly in summer and autumn and ate cephalopods and fishes. M.-�griseus preyed on various crustaceans and decreased the diversity of food with growth. M.-�manazo preferred crustaceans and polychaetes. There was no certain tendency in the diversity of the food habit for M.-�manazo},

Standardized sampling at Fernando de Noronha indicated that parturition occurred from February to April and that a wide depth-range (at least 5-30�m) along the insular shelf was used by immature sharks throughout the year. The catch-per-unit effort of C. perezi was significantly higher inside than outside a marine protected area at this location, suggesting that these sharks are more common in parts of the reef least disturbed by human activities. More limited sampling at Atol das Rocas suggested that juvenile C. perezi occurred at similar depths and utilized similar substrate as sharks at Fernando de Noronha.

	abstract = {The tagging of sharks using conventional tags has long been recognized as a valuable means for studying various aspects of their life history, migrations and movements, and population structure. Conventional tags are defined as those that can be identified visually without the use of special detection equipment. Tagging studies specifically targeting sharks began in the late 1920's, and today numerous cooperative shark tagging programs exist worldwide. Cooperative programs depend on the joint participation of scientists and public volunteers to accomplish research objectives. Benefits and problems of these programs are discussed using the tagging methodologies, protocols, and results of the National Marine Fisheries Service Cooperative Shark Tagging Program. An additional 63 shark tagging studies and programs of all types are reviewed. Information useful for behavioral, biological, and fishery management studies can be derived from data resulting from these studies, including species and size composition, sex ratios, spatial and temporal distribution, migrations, movement patterns, rates of travel, delineation of pupping grounds, distribution of maturity intervals, indices of relative abundance, and recognition of individuals. Specific tagging experiments can be designed to provide additional data on age and growth, homing and site fidelity, dispersal rate, residence time, movement rates, tag shedding, and population parameters (e.g. size, mortality, recruitment, exploitation, interaction rates, and stock identity). Sources of bias inherent in tagging and recapture data include mortality, variation in tagging effort and fishing pressure, non-recovery and non-reporting of tags, and tag shedding. Recent advances in tagging methodologies that complement and extend conventional tagging studies will further our knowledge on shark movements and migrations, particularly in the areas of resource utilization and management, space utilization, and population dynamics},

Deep-water chondrichthyans had a higher age at maturity and longevity, and a lower growth completion rate than shallow-water species. The average fishing mortality needed to drive a deep-water chondrichthyan species to extinction (Fextinct) was 38-58\% of that estimated for oceanic and continental shelf species, respectively. Mean values of Fextinct were 0.149, 0.250 and 0.368 for deep-water, oceanic and continental shelf species, respectively. Reproductive mode was an important determinant of extinction risk, while body size had a weak effect on extinction risk. As extinction risk was highly correlated with phylogeny, the loss of species will be accompanied by a loss of phylogenetic diversity. Conservation priority should not be restricted to large species, as is usually suggested, since many small species, like those inhabiting the deep ocean, are also highly vulnerable to extinction. Fishing mortality of deep-water chondrichthyans already exploited should be minimized, and new deep-water fisheries affecting chondrichthyans should be prevented.},

	abstract = {Sharks and other large predators are scarce on most coral reefs, but studies of their historical ecology provide qualitative evidence that predators were once numerous in these ecosystems. Quantifying density of sharks in the absence of humans (baseline) is, however, hindered by a paucity of pertinent time-series data. Recently researchers have used underwater visual surveys, primarily of limited spatial extent or nonstandard design, to infer negative associations between reef shark abundance and human populations. We analyzed data from 1607 towed-diver surveys ({\textgreater}1 ha transects surveyed by observers towed behind a boat) conducted at 46 reefs in the central-western Pacific Ocean, reefs that included some of the world's most pristine coral reefs. Estimates of shark density from towed-diver surveys were substantially lower ({\textless}10\%) than published estimates from surveys along small transects ({\textless}0.02 ha), which is not consistent with inverted biomass pyramids (predator biomass greater than prey biomass) reported by other researchers for pristine reefs. We examined the relation between the density of reef sharks observed in towed-diver surveys and human population in models that accounted for the influence of oceanic primary productivity, sea surface temperature, reef area, and reef physical complexity. We used these models to estimate the density of sharks in the absence of humans. Densities of gray reef sharks (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos), whitetip reef sharks (Triaenodon obesus), and the group "all reef sharks" increased substantially as human population decreased and as primary productivity and minimum sea surface temperature (or reef area, which was highly correlated with temperature) increased. Simulated baseline densities of reef sharks under the absence of humans were 1.1-2.4/ha for the main Hawaiian Islands, 1.2-2.4/ha for inhabited islands of American Samoa, and 0.9-2.1/ha for inhabited islands in the Mariana Archipelago, which suggests that density of reef sharks has declined to 3-10\% of baseline levels in these areas.},

	abstract = {Investigation of the social framing of human-shark interactions may provide useful strategies for integrating social, biological, and ecological knowledge into national and international policy discussions about shark conservation. One way to investigate social opinion and forces related to sharks and their conservation is through the media's coverage of sharks. We conducted a content analysis of 300 shark-related articles published in 20 major Australian and U.S. newspapers from 2000 to 2010. Shark attacks were the emphasis of over half the articles analyzed, and shark conservation was the primary topic of 11\% of articles. Significantly more Australian articles than U.S. articles treated shark attacks (χ(2) = 3.862; Australian 58\% vs. U.S. 47\%) and shark conservation issues (χ(2) = 6.856; Australian 15\% vs. U.S. 11\%) as the primary article topic and used politicians as the primary risk messenger (i.e., primary person or authority sourced in the article) (χ(2) = 7.493; Australian 8\% vs. U.S. 1\%). However, significantly more U.S. articles than Australian articles discussed sharks as entertainment (e.g., subjects in movies, books, and television; χ(2) = 15.130; U.S. 6\% vs. Australian 1\%) and used scientists as the primary risk messenger (χ(2) = 5.333; U.S. 25\% vs. Australian 15\%). Despite evidence that many shark species are at risk of extinction, we found that most media coverage emphasized the risks sharks pose to people. To the extent that media reflects social opinion, our results highlight problems for shark conservation. We suggest that conservation professionals purposefully and frequently engage with the media to highlight the rarity of shark attacks, discuss preventative measures water users can take to reduce their vulnerability to shark encounters, and discuss conservation issues related to local and threatened species of sharks. When integrated with biological and ecological data, social-science data may help generate a more comprehensive perspective and inform conservation practice.

Over the last decade, marine scientists from different disciplines have engaged in the emerging field of marine historical ecology to reconstruct past changes in the sea. Here we review the diversity of approaches used and resulting patterns of historical changes in large marine mammals, birds, reptiles and fish. Across 256 reviewed records, exploited populations declined 89\% from historical abundance levels (range: 11-100\%). In many cases, long-term fluctuations are related to climate variation, rapid declines to overexploitation and recent recoveries to conservation measures. These emerging historical patterns offer new insights into past ecosystems, and provide important context for contemporary ocean management.},

	abstract = {The blue shark Prionace glauca is the most abundant large pelagic shark in the Atlantic Ocean. Although recaptures of tagged sharks have shown that the species is highly migratory, migration pathways towards the overwintering grounds remain poorly understood. We used archival satellite pop-up tags to track 23 blue sharks over a mean period of 88 days as they departed the coastal waters of North America in the autumn. Within 1-2 days of entering the Gulf Stream (median date of 21 Oct), all sharks initiated a striking diel vertical migration, taking them from a mean nighttime depth of 74 m to a mean depth of 412 m during the day as they appeared to pursue vertically migrating squid and fish prey. Although functionally blind at depth, calculations suggest that there would be a  ̃2.5-fold thermoregulatory advantage to swimming and feeding in the markedly cooler deep waters, even if there was any reduced foraging success associated with the extreme depth. Noting that the Gulf Stream current speeds are reduced at depth, we used a detailed circulation model of the North Atlantic to examine the influence of the diving behaviour on the advection experienced by the sharks. However, there was no indication that the shark diving resulted in a significant modification of their net migratory pathway. The relative abundance of deep-diving sharks, swordfish, and sperm whales in the Gulf Stream and adjacent waters suggests that it may serve as a key winter feeding ground for large pelagic predators in the North Atlantic.},

	abstract = {Despite being the second largest fish, basking sharks (Cetorhinus maximus) have been assumed to remain in discrete populations. Their known distribution encompasses temperate continental shelf areas, yet until now there has been no evidence for migration across oceans or between hemispheres. Here we present results on the tracks and behaviour of two basking sharks tagged off the British Isles, one of which released its tag off Newfoundland, Canada. During the shark's transit of the North Atlantic, she travelled a horizontal distance of 9589 km and reached a record depth of 1264 m. This result provides the first evidence for a link between European and American populations and indicates that basking sharks make use of deep-water habitats beyond the shelf edge.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0027693},
	abstract = {Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) is considered to be overfished, but the status of its populations has been debated, partly because of uncertainties regarding the effects of mixing on fishing grounds. A better understanding of spatial structure and mixing may help fisheries managers to successfully rebuild populations to sustainable levels while maximizing catches. We formulate a new seasonally and spatially explicit fisheries model that is fitted to conventional and electronic tag data, historic catch-at-age reconstructions, and otolith microchemistry stock-composition data to improve the capacity to assess past, current, and future population sizes of Atlantic bluefin tuna. We apply the model to estimate spatial and temporal mixing of the eastern (Mediterranean) and western (Gulf of Mexico) populations, and to reconstruct abundances from 1950 to 2008. We show that western and eastern populations have been reduced to 17\% and 33\%, respectively, of 1950 spawning stock biomass levels. Overfishing to below the biomass that produces maximum sustainable yield occurred in the 1960s and the late 1990s for western and eastern populations, respectively. The model predicts that mixing depends on season, ontogeny, and location, and is highest in the western Atlantic. Assuming that future catches are zero, western and eastern populations are predicted to recover to levels at maximum sustainable yield by 2025 and 2015, respectively. However, the western population will not recover with catches of 1750 and 12,900 tonnes (the "rebuilding quotas") in the western and eastern Atlantic, respectively, with or without closures in the Gulf of Mexico. If future catches are double the rebuilding quotas, then rebuilding of both populations will be compromised. If fishing were to continue in the eastern Atlantic at the unregulated levels of 2007, both stocks would continue to decline. Since populations mix on North Atlantic foraging grounds, successful rebuilding policies will benefit from trans-Atlantic cooperation.},

Almost nothing is known about manta ray movements and their environmental preferences, making them one of the least understood of the marine mega-vertebrates. Red listed by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature as 'Vulnerable' to extinction, manta rays are known to be subject to direct and incidental capture and some populations are declining. Satellite-tracked manta rays associated with seasonal upwelling events and thermal fronts off the Yucatan peninsula, Mexico, and made short-range shuttling movements, foraging along and between them. The majority of locations were received from waters shallower than 50 m deep, representing thermally dynamic and productive waters. Manta rays remained in the Mexican Exclusive Economic Zone for the duration of tracking but only 12\% of tracking locations were received from within Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). Our results on the spatio-temporal distribution of these enigmatic rays highlight opportunities and challenges to management efforts.},

	abstract = {The Mobulidae are zooplanktivorous elasmobranchs comprising two recognized species of manta rays (Manta spp.) and nine recognized species of devil rays (Mobula spp.). They are found circumglobally in tropical, subtropical and temperate coastal waters. Although mobulids have been recorded for over 400 years, critical knowledge gaps still compromise the ability to assess the status of these species. On the basis of a review of 263 publications, a comparative synthesis of the biology and ecology of mobulids was conducted to examine their evolution, taxonomy, distribution, population trends, movements and aggregation, reproduction, growth and longevity, feeding, natural mortality and direct and indirect anthropogenic threats. There has been a marked increase in the number of published studies on mobulids since c. 1990, particularly for the genus Manta, although the genus Mobula remains poorly understood. Mobulid species have many common biological characteristics although their ecologies appear to be species-specific, and sometimes region-specific. Movement studies suggest that mobulids are highly mobile and have the potential to rapidly travel large distances. Fishing pressure is the major threat to many mobulid populations, with current levels of exploitation in target fisheries unlikely to be sustainable. Advances in the fields of population genetics, acoustic and satellite tracking, and stable-isotope and fatty-acid analyses will provide new insights into the biology and ecology of these species. Future research should focus on the uncertain taxonomy of mobulid species, the degree of overlap between their large-scale movement and human activities such as fisheries and pollution, and the need for management of inter-jurisdictional fisheries in developing nations to ensure their long-term sustainability. Closer collaboration among researchers worldwide is necessary to ensure standardized sampling and modelling methodologies to underpin global population estimates and status.},

	abstract = {Marine biodiversity worldwide is under increasing threat, primarily as a result of over-harvesting, pollution and climate change. Chondrichthyan fishes (sharks, rays and chimaeras) have a perceived higher intrinsic risk of extinction compared to other fish. Direct fishing mortality has driven many declines, even though some smaller fisheries persist without associated declines. Mixed-species fisheries are of particular concern, as is illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. The lack of specific management and reporting mechanisms for the latter means that many chondrichthyans might already be susceptible to extinction from stochastic processes entirely unrelated to fishing pressure itself. Chondrichthyans might also suffer relatively more than other marine taxa from the effects of fishing and habitat loss and degradation given coastal habitat use for specific life stages. The effects of invasive species and pollution are as yet too poorly understood to predict their long-term role in affecting chondrichthyan population sizes. The spatial distribution of threatened chondrichthyan species under World Conservation Union (IUCN) Red List criteria are clustered mainly in (1) south-eastern South America; (2) western Europe and the Mediterranean; (3) western Africa; (4) South China Sea and Southeast Asia and (5) south-eastern Australia. To determine which ecological and life history traits predispose chondrichthyans to being IUCN Red-Listed, and to examine the role of particular human activities in exacerbating threat risk, we correlated extant marine species' Red List categorisation with available ecological (habitat type, temperature preference), life history (body length, range size) and human-relationship (whether commercially or game-fished, considered dangerous to humans) variables. Threat risk correlations were constructed using generalised linear mixed-effect models to account for phylogenetic relatedness. We also contrasted results for chondrichthyans to marine teleosts to test explicitly whether the former group is intrinsically more susceptible to extinction than fishes in general. Around 52\% of chondrichthyans have been Red-Listed compared to only 8\% of all marine teleosts; however, listed teleosts were in general placed more frequently into the higher-risk categories relative to chondrichthyans. IUCN threat risk in both taxa was positively correlated with body size and negatively correlated albeit weakly, with geographic range size. Even after accounting for the positive influence of size, Red-Listed teleosts were still more likely than chondrichthyans to be classified as threatened. We suggest that while sharks might not have necessarily experienced the same magnitude of deterministic decline as Red-Listed teleosts, their larger size and lower fecundity (not included in the analysis) predispose chondrichthyans to a higher risk of extinction overall. Removal of these large predators can elicit trophic cascades and destabilise the relative abundance of smaller species. Predator depletions can lead to permanent shifts in marine communities and alternate equilibrium states. Climate change might influence the phenology and physiology of some species, with the most probable response being changes in the timing of migrations and shifts in distribution. The synergistic effects among harvesting, habitat changes and climate-induced forcings are greatest for coastal chondrichthyans with specific habitat requirements and these are currently the most likely candidates for extinction. Management of shark populations must take into account the rate at which drivers of decline affect specific species. Only through the detailed collection of data describing demographic rates, habitat affinities, trophic linkages and geographic ranges, and how environmental stressors modify these, can extinction risk be more precisely estimated and reduced. The estimation of minimum viable population sizes, below which rapid extinction is more likely due to stochastic processes, is an important component of this endeavour and should accompany many of the current approaches used in shark management worldwide.},

	abstract = {Recent reports suggest that many well-assessed fisheries in developed countries are moving toward sustainability. We examined whether the same conclusion holds for fisheries lacking formal assessment, which comprise {\textgreater}80\% of global catch. We developed a method using species' life-history, catch, and fishery development data to estimate the status of thousands of unassessed fisheries worldwide. We found that small unassessed fisheries are in substantially worse condition than assessed fisheries, but that large unassessed fisheries may be performing nearly as well as their assessed counterparts. Both small and large stocks, however, continue to decline; 64\% of unassessed stocks could provide increased sustainable harvest if rebuilt. Our results suggest that global fishery recovery would simultaneously create increases in abundance (56\%) and fishery yields (8 to 40\%).},

	abstract = {One billion people depend on seafood as their primary source of protein and 25\% of the world's total animal protein comes from fisheries. Yet a third of fish stocks worldwide are overexploited or depleted. Using individual case studies, many have argued that community-based co-management should prevent the tragedy of the commons because cooperative management by fishers, managers and scientists often results in sustainable fisheries. However, general and multidisciplinary evaluations of co-management regimes and the conditions for social, economic and ecological success within such regimes are lacking. Here we examine 130 co-managed fisheries in a wide range of countries with different degrees of development, ecosystems, fishing sectors and type of resources. We identified strong leadership as the most important attribute contributing to success, followed by individual or community quotas, social cohesion and protected areas. Less important conditions included enforcement mechanisms, long-term management policies and life history of the resources. Fisheries were most successful when at least eight co-management attributes were present, showing a strong positive relationship between the number of these attributes and success, owing to redundancy in management regulations. Our results demonstrate the critical importance of prominent community leaders and robust social capital, combined with clear incentives through catch shares and conservation benefits derived from protected areas, for successfully managing aquatic resources and securing the livelihoods of communities depending on them. Our study offers hope that co-management, the only realistic solution for the majority of the world's fisheries, can solve many of the problems facing global fisheries.},

	abstract = {Ten years have passed since the last synopsis of whale shark Rhincodon typus biogeography. While a recent review of the species' biology and ecology summarized the vast data collected since then, it is clear that information on population geographic connectivity, migration and demography of R. typus is still limited and scattered. Understanding R. typus migratory behaviour is central to its conservation management considering the genetic evidence suggesting local aggregations are connected at the generational scale over entire ocean basins. By collating available data on sightings, tracked movements and distribution information, this review provides evidence for the hypothesis of broad-scale connectivity among populations, and generates a model describing how the world's R. typus are part of a single, global meta-population. Rhincodon typus occurrence timings and distribution patterns make possible a connection between several aggregation sites in the Indian Ocean. The present conceptual model and validating data lend support to the hypothesis that R. typus are able to move among the three largest ocean basins with a minimum total travelling time of around 2-4 years. The model provides a worldwide perspective of possible R. typus migration routes, and suggests a modified focus for additional research to test its predictions. The framework can be used to trim the hypotheses for R. typus movements and aggregation timings, thereby isolating possible mating and breeding areas that are currently unknown. This will assist endeavours to predict the longer-term response of the species to ocean warming and changing patterns of human-induced mortality.},

	abstract = {Sharks and rays' abundance can decline considerably with fishing. Community changes, however, are more complex because of species interactions, and variable vulnerability and exposure to fishing. We evaluated long-term changes in the elasmobranch community of the Adriatic Sea, a heavily exploited Mediterranean basin where top-predators have been strongly depleted historically, and fishing developed unevenly between the western and eastern side. Combining and standardizing catch data from five trawl surveys from 1948-2005, we estimated abundance trends and explained community changes using life histories, fish-market and effort data, and historical information. We identified a highly depleted elasmobranch community. Since 1948, catch rates have declined by {\textgreater}94\% and 11 species ceased to be detected. The exploitation history and spatial gradients in fishing pressure explained most patterns in abundance and diversity, including the absence of strong compensatory increases. Ecological corridors and large-scale protected areas emerged as potential management options for elasmobranch conservation.},

	abstract = {Serious concerns have been raised about the ecological effects of industrialized fishing, spurring a United Nations resolution on restoring fisheries and marine ecosystems to healthy levels. However, a prerequisite for restoration is a general understanding of the composition and abundance of unexploited fish communities, relative to contemporary ones. We constructed trajectories of community biomass and composition of large predatory fishes in four continental shelf and nine oceanic systems, using all available data from the beginning of exploitation. Industrialized fisheries typically reduced community biomass by 80\% within 15 years of exploitation. Compensatory increases in fast-growing species were observed, but often reversed within a decade. Using a meta-analytic approach, we estimate that large predatory fish biomass today is only about 10\% of pre-industrial levels. We conclude that declines of large predators in coastal regions have extended throughout the global ocean, with potentially serious consequences for ecosystems. Our analysis suggests that management based on recent data alone may be misleading, and provides minimum estimates for unexploited communities, which could serve as the 'missing baseline' needed for future restoration efforts.},

While the status of commercially important species is available, abundance trend information for other coastal shark species in the north-west Atlantic Ocean are unavailable. Using a generalized linear modelling (GLM) approach, a relative abundance index was derived from 1994 to 2009 using observer data collected in a commercial bottom longline fishery. Trends in abundance and average size were estimated for bull shark Carcharhinus leucas, spinner shark Carcharhinus brevipinna, tiger shark Galeocerdo cuvier and lemon shark Negaprion brevirostris. Increases in relative abundance for all shark species ranged from 14\% for C. brevipinna, 12\% for C. leucas, 6\% for N. brevirostris and 3\% for G. cuvier. There was no significant change in the size at capture over the time period considered for all species. While the status of shark populations should not be based exclusively on abundance trend information, but ultimately on stock assessment models, results from this study provide some cause for optimism on the status of these coastal shark species.},

	abstract = {Understanding which species are most vulnerable to human impacts is a prerequisite for designing effective conservation strategies. Surveys of terrestrial species have suggested that large-bodied species and top predators are the most at risk, and it is commonly assumed that such patterns also apply in the ocean. However, there has been no global test of this hypothesis in the sea. We analyzed two fisheries datasets (stock assessments and landings) to determine the life-history traits of species that have suffered dramatic population collapses. Contrary to expectations, our data suggest that up to twice as many fisheries for small, low trophic-level species have collapsed compared with those for large predators. These patterns contrast with those on land, suggesting fundamental differences in the ways that industrial fisheries and land conversion affect natural communities. Even temporary collapses of small, low trophic-level fishes can have ecosystem-wide impacts by reducing food supply to larger fish, seabirds, and marine mammals.},

We analyzed all available data from Pacific tuna fisheries for 1950-2004 to provide comprehensive estimates of fishery impacts on population biomass and size structure. Current biomass ranges among species from 36 to 91\% of the biomass predicted in the absence of fishing, a level consistent with or higher than standard fisheries management targets. Fish larger than 175 centimeters fork length have decreased from 5\% to approximately 1\% of the total population. The trophic level of the catch has decreased slightly, but there is no detectable decrease in the trophic level of the population. These results indicate substantial, though not catastrophic, impacts of fisheries on these top-level predators and minor impacts on the ecosystem in the Pacific Ocean.},

	abstract = {Globally, many fish species are overexploited, and many stocks have collapsed. This crisis, along with increasing concerns over flow-on effects on ecosystems, has caused a reevaluation of traditional fisheries management practices, and a new ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) paradigm has emerged. As part of this approach, selective fishing is widely encouraged in the belief that nonselective fishing has many adverse impacts. In particular, incidental bycatch is seen as wasteful and a negative feature of fishing, and methods to reduce bycatch are implemented in many fisheries. However, recent advances in fishery science and ecology suggest that a selective approach may also result in undesirable impacts both to fisheries and marine ecosystems. Selective fishing applies one or more of the "6-S" selections: species, stock, size, sex, season, and space. However, selective fishing alters biodiversity, which in turn changes ecosystem functioning and may affect fisheries production, hindering rather than helping achieve the goals of EBFM. We argue here that a "balanced exploitation" approach might alleviate many of the ecological effects of fishing by avoiding intensive removal of particular components of the ecosystem, while still supporting sustainable fisheries. This concept may require reducing exploitation rates on certain target species or groups to protect vulnerable components of the ecosystem. Benefits to society could be maintained or even increased because a greater proportion of the entire suite of harvested species is used.},

	abstract = {Changes in the management of the fin fish fishery of the Great Barrier Reef motivated us to investigate the combined effects on economic returns and fish biomass of no-take areas and regulated total allowable catch allocated in the form of individual transferable quotas (such quotas apportion the total allowable catch as fishing rights and permits the buying and selling of these rights among fishers). We built a spatially explicit biological and economic model of the fishery to analyze the trade-offs between maintaining given levels of fish biomass and the net financial returns from fishing under different management regimes. Results of the scenarios we modeled suggested that a decrease in total allowable catch at high levels of harvest either increased net returns or lowered them only slightly, but increased biomass by up to 10\% for a wide range of reserve sizes and an increase in the reserve area from none to 16\% did not greatly change net returns at any catch level. Thus, catch shares and no-take reserves can be complementary and when these methods are used jointly they promote lower total allowable catches when harvest is relatively high and encourage larger no-take areas when they are small.},

	abstract = {Recovery of overexploited marine populations has been slow, and most remain below target biomass levels. A key question is whether this is due to insufficient reductions in harvest rates or the erosion of population resilience. Using a global meta-analysis of overfished stocks, we find that resilience of those stocks subjected to moderate levels of overfishing is enhanced, not compromised, offering the possibility of swift recovery. However, prolonged intense overexploitation, especially for collapsed stocks, not only delays rebuilding but also substantially increases the uncertainty in recovery times, despite predictable influences of fishing and life history. Timely and decisive reductions in harvest rates could mitigate this uncertainty. Instead, current harvest and low biomass levels render recovery improbable for the majority of the world's depleted stocks.},

	abstract = {South Africa is reputed to host the world's largest remaining population of white sharks, yet no studies have accurately determined a population estimate based on mark-recapture of live individuals. We used dorsal fin photographs (fin IDs) to identify white sharks in Gansbaai, South Africa, from January 2007 - December 2011. We used the computer programme DARWIN to catalogue and match fin IDs of individuals; this is the first study to successfully use the software for white shark identification. The programme performed well despite a number of individual fins showing drastic changes in dorsal fin shape over time. Of 1682 fin IDs used, 532 unique individuals were identified. We estimated population size using the open-population POPAN parameterisation in Program MARK, which estimated the superpopulation size at 908 (95\% confidence interval 808-1008). This estimated population size is considerably larger than those described at other aggregation areas of the species and is comparable to a previous South African population estimate conducted 16 years prior. Our assessment suggests the species has not made a marked recovery since being nationally protected in 1991. As such, additional international protection may prove vital for the long-term conservation of this threatened species.},

	abstract = {We show how theoretical developments in macroecology, life-history theory and food-web ecology can be combined to formulate a simple model for predicting the potential biomass, production, size and trophic structure of consumer communities. The strength of our approach is that it uses remote sensing data to predict properties of consumer communities in environments that are challenging and expensive to sample directly. An application of the model to the marine environment on a global scale, using primary production and temperature estimates from satellite remote sensing as inputs, suggests that the global biomass of marine animals more than 10(-5) g wet weight is 2.62 x 10(9)t (=8.16 gm(-2) ocean) and production is 1.00 x 10(10) tyr-1 (31.15 gm(-2)yr(-1)). Based on the life-history theory, we propose and apply an approximation for distinguishing the relative contributions of different animal groups. Fish biomass and production, for example, are estimated as 8.99 x 10(8)t (2.80 gm(-2)) and 7.91 x 108 t yr(-1) (2.46 gm(2)yr(-1)respectively, and 50\% of fish biomass is shown to occur in 17\% of the total ocean area (8.22 gm(-2)). The analyses show that emerging ecological theory can be synthesized to set baselines for assessing human and climate impacts on global scales.},

	abstract = {Illegal and unreported fishing contributes to overexploitation of fish stocks and is a hindrance to the recovery of fish populations and ecosystems. This study is the first to undertake a world-wide analysis of illegal and unreported fishing. Reviewing the situation in 54 countries and on the high seas, we estimate that lower and upper estimates of the total value of current illegal and unreported fishing losses worldwide are between \$10 bn and \$23.5 bn annually, representing between 11 and 26 million tonnes. Our data are of sufficient resolution to detect regional differences in the level and trend of illegal fishing over the last 20 years, and we can report a significant correlation between governance and the level of illegal fishing. Developing countries are most at risk from illegal fishing, with total estimated catches in West Africa being 40\% higher than reported catches. Such levels of exploitation severely hamper the sustainable management of marine ecosystems. Although there have been some successes in reducing the level of illegal fishing in some areas, these developments are relatively recent and follow growing international focus on the problem. This paper provides the baseline against which successful action to curb illegal fishing can be judged.},

	abstract = {Despite growing concerns about overexploitation of sharks, lack of accurate, species-specific harvest data often hampers quantitative stock assessment. In such cases, trade studies can provide insights into exploitation unavailable from traditional monitoring. We applied Bayesian statistical methods to trade data in combination with genetic identification to estimate by species, the annual number of globally traded shark fins, the most commercially valuable product from a group of species often unrecorded in harvest statistics. Our results provide the first fishery-independent estimate of the scale of shark catches worldwide and indicate that shark biomass in the fin trade is three to four times higher than shark catch figures reported in the only global data base. Comparison of our estimates to approximated stock assessment reference points for one of the most commonly traded species, blue shark, suggests that current trade volumes in numbers of sharks are close to or possibly exceeding the maximum sustainable yield levels.},

	abstract = {Recently, the global state of marine fisheries and its effects on ecosystems have received much scientific (and public) scrutiny. There is little doubt that global limits to exploitation have been reached and that recovery of depleted stocks must become a cornerstone of fisheries management. Yet, current trends appear to be diverging between well-assessed regions showing stabilization of fish biomass and other regions continuing to decline. This divergence can be explained by improved controls on exploitation rates in several wealthy countries, but low management capacity elsewhere. Here, we identify an urgent need to direct priorities towards 'fisheries-conservation hotspots' of increasing exploitation rates, high biodiversity, and poor management capacity, and conclude that the future of fish depends, at least in part, on redoubling science, co-management and conservation efforts in those regions.},

	abstract = {Overfishing of sharks is a global concern, with increasing numbers of species threatened by overfishing. For many sharks, both catch rates and underwater visual surveys have been criticized as indices of abundance. In this context, estimation of population trends using individual demographic rates provides an important alternative means of assessing population status. However, such estimates involve uncertainties that must be appropriately characterized to credibly and effectively inform conservation efforts and management. Incorporating uncertainties into population assessment is especially important when key demographic rates are obtained via indirect methods, as is often the case for mortality rates of marine organisms subject to fishing. Here, focusing on two reef shark species on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, we estimated natural and total mortality rates using several indirect methods, and determined the population growth rates resulting from each. We used bootstrapping to quantify the uncertainty associated with each estimate, and to evaluate the extent of agreement between estimates. Multiple models produced highly concordant natural and total mortality rates, and associated population growth rates, once the uncertainties associated with the individual estimates were taken into account. Consensus estimates of natural and total population growth across multiple models support the hypothesis that these species are declining rapidly due to fishing, in contrast to conclusions previously drawn from catch rate trends. Moreover, quantitative projections of abundance differences on fished versus unfished reefs, based on the population growth rate estimates, are comparable to those found in previous studies using underwater visual surveys. These findings appear to justify management actions to substantially reduce the fishing mortality of reef sharks. They also highlight the potential utility of rigorously characterizing uncertainty, and applying multiple assessment methods, to obtain robust estimates of population trends in species threatened by overfishing.},

	abstract = {White sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) are threatened apex predators and identification of their critical habitats and how these are used are essential to ensuring improved local and ultimately global white shark protection. In this study we investigated habitat use by white sharks in False Bay, South Africa, using acoustic telemetry. 56 sharks (39 female, 17 male), ranging in size from 1.7-5 m TL, were tagged with acoustic transmitters and monitored on an array of 30 receivers for 975 days. To investigate the effects of season, sex and size on habitat use we used a generalized linear mixed effects model. Tagged sharks were detected in the Bay in all months and across all years, but their use of the Bay varied significantly with the season and the sex of the shark. In autumn and winter males and females aggregated around the Cape fur seal colony at Seal Island, where they fed predominantly on young of the year seals. In spring and summer there was marked sexual segregation, with females frequenting the Inshore areas and males seldom being detected. The shift from the Island in autumn and winter to the Inshore region in spring and summer by females mirrors the seasonal peak in abundance of juvenile seals and of migratory teleost and elasmobranch species respectively. This study provides the first evidence of sexual segregation at a fine spatial scale and demonstrates that sexual segregation in white sharks is not restricted to adults, but is apparent for juveniles and sub-adults too. Overall, the results confirm False Bay as a critical area for white shark conservation as both sexes, across a range of sizes, frequent the Bay on an annual basis. The finding that female sharks aggregate in the Inshore regions when recreational use peaks highlights the need for ongoing shark-human conflict mitigation strategies.},

	abstract = {A demographic technique is used to compare the intrinsic rates of population increase of 26 shark species hypothetically exposed to fishing mortality. These rates (r2M) are used as a measure of the relative ability of different sharks to recover from fishing pressure. The method incorporates concepts of density dependence from standard population modelling and uses female age at maturity, maximum reproductive age, and average fecundity. A compensatory response to population reduction is assumed in pre-adult survival to the extent possible given the constraints of the life-history parameters. ‘Rebound’ productivity was strongly affected by age at maturity and little affected by maximum age. Species with lowest values (r2M {\textless} 0.04) tended to be late-maturing medium- to large-sized coastal sharks, whereas those with the highest ({\textgreater} 0.08) were small coastal, early-maturing species. Sharks with mid-range values (r2M = 0.04–0.07) were mostly large ({\textgreater} 250 cm maximum size) pelagic species, relatively fast growing and early maturing. Possible selection pressures for these three shark groups, management implications, practical applications for the derived parameter r2M, and recommended areas of research are discussed.},

	abstract = {Accurate assessment of shark population status is essential for conservation but is often constrained by limited and unreliable data. To provide a basis for improved management of shark resources, we analyzed a long-term record of species-specific catches, sizes, and sexes of sharks collected by onboard observers in the western and central Pacific Ocean from 1995 to 2010. Using generalized linear models, we estimated population-status indicators on the basis of catch rate and biological indicators of fishing pressure on the basis of median size to identify trends for blue (Prionace glauca), mako (Isurus spp.), oceanic whitetip (Carcharhinus longimanus), and silky (Carcharhinus falciformis) sharks. Standardized catch rates of longline fleets declined significantly for blue sharks in the North Pacific (by 5\% per year [CI 2\% to 8\%]), for mako sharks in the North Pacific (by 7\% per year [CI 3\% to 11\%]), and for oceanic whitetip sharks in tropical waters (by 17\% per year [CI 14\% to 20\%]). Median lengths of silky and oceanic whitetip sharks decreased significantly in their core habitat, and almost all sampled silky sharks were immature. Our results are consistent with results of analyses of similar data sets. Combined, these results and evidence of targeted fishing for sharks in some regional fisheries heighten concerns for sustainable utilization, particularly for oceanic whitetip and North Pacific blue sharks. Regional regulations that prohibit shark finning (removal of fins and discarding of the carcass) were enacted in 2007 and are in many cases the only form of control on shark catches. However, there is little evidence of a reduction of finning in longline fisheries. In addition, silky and oceanic whitetip sharks are more frequently retained than finned, which suggests that even full implementation of and adherence to a finning prohibition may not substantially reduce mortality rates for these species. We argue that finning prohibitions divert attention from assessing whether catch levels are sustainable and that the need for management of sharks should not be addressed by measures that are simple to implement but complex to enforce and evaluate.},

	abstract = {Conventional methods for management of data-rich fisheries maintain sustainable populations by assuring that lifetime reproduction is adequate for individuals to replace themselves and accounting for density-dependent recruitment. Fishing is not allowed to reduce relative lifetime reproduction, the fraction of current egg production relative to unfished egg production (FLEP), below a sustainable level. Because most shark fisheries are data poor, other representations of persistence status have been used, including linear demographic models, which incorporate life-history characteristics in age-structured models with no density dependence. We tested how well measures of sustainability from 3 linear demographic methods (rebound potential, stochastic growth rate, and potential population increase) reflect actual population persistence by comparing values of these measures with FLEP for 26 shark species. We also calculated the value of fishing mortality (F) that would allow all 26 species to maintain an accepted precautionary threshold for sharks of FLEP = 60\%, expressing F as a fraction of natural mortality (M). Values of stochastic growth rate and potential population growth did not covary in rank order with FLEP (p = 0.057 and p = 0.077, respectively) and neither was significantly correlated with FLEP. Ordinal ranking of rebound potential positively covaried with FLEP (p = 0.00013), but the relative rankings of some species were substantially out of order. Adopting a sustainable limit of F = 0.16M would maintain all 26 species above the precautionary minimum value of FLEP (60\%). We concluded that shark-fishery and conservation policies should rely on calculation of replacement (i.e., FLEP), and that sharks should be fished at a precautionary level that would protect all stocks (i.e., F{\textless} 0.16M).},

	abstract = {Although marine protected areas (MPAs) are a common conservation strategy, these areas are often designed with little prior knowledge of the spatial behaviour of the species they are designed to protect. Currently, the Coral Sea area and its seamounts (north-east Australia) are under review to determine if MPAs are warranted. The protection of sharks at these seamounts should be an integral component of conservation plans. Therefore, knowledge on the spatial ecology of sharks at the Coral Sea seamounts is essential for the appropriate implementation of management and conservation plans. Acoustic telemetry was used to determine residency, site fidelity and spatial use of three shark species at Osprey Reef: whitetip reef sharks Triaenodon obesus, grey reef sharks Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos and silvertip sharks Carcharhinus albimarginatus. Most individuals showed year round residency at Osprey Reef, although five of the 49 individuals tagged moved to the neighbouring Shark Reef ( ̃14 km away) and one grey reef shark completed a round trip of  ̃250 km to the Great Barrier Reef. Additionally, individuals of white tip and grey reef sharks showed strong site fidelity to the areas they were tagged, and there was low spatial overlap between groups of sharks tagged at different locations. Spatial use at Osprey Reef by adult sharks is generally restricted to the north-west corner. The high residency and limited spatial use of Osprey Reef suggests that reef sharks would be highly vulnerable to targeted fishing pressure and that MPAs incorporating no-take of sharks would be effective in protecting reef shark populations at Osprey and Shark Reef.},

	abstract = {For species listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service are tasked with writing recovery plans that include "objective, measurable criteria" that define when a species is no longer at risk of extinction, but neither the act itself nor agency guidelines provide an explicit definition of objective, measurable criteria. Past reviews of recovery plans, including one published in 2012, show that many criteria lack quantitative metrics with clear biological rationale and are not meeting the measureable and objective mandate. I reviewed how objective, measureable criteria have been defined implicitly and explicitly in peer-reviewed literature, the ESA, other U.S. statutes, and legal decisions. Based on a synthesis of these sources, I propose the following 6 standards be used as minimum requirements for objective, measurable criteria: contain a quantitative threshold with calculable units, stipulate a timeframe over which they must be met, explicitly define the spatial extent or population to which they apply, specify a sampling procedure that includes sample size, specify a statistical significance level, and include justification by providing scientific evidence that the criteria define a species whose extinction risk has been reduced to the desired level. To meet these 6 standards, I suggest that recovery plans be explicitly guided by and organized around a population viability modeling framework even if data or agency resources are too limited to complete a viability model. When data and resources are available, recovery criteria can be developed from the population viability model results, but when data and resources are insufficient for model implementation, extinction risk thresholds can be used as criteria. A recovery-planning approach centered on viability modeling will also yield appropriately focused data-acquisition and monitoring plans and will facilitate a seamless transition from recovery planning to delisting.

	abstract = {Although there are many indicators of endangerment (i.e., whether populations or species meet criteria that justify conservation action), their reliability has rarely been tested. Such indicators may fail to identify that a population or species meets criteria for conservation action (false negative) or may incorrectly show that such criteria have been met (false positive). To quantify the rate of both types of error for 20 commonly used indicators of declining abundance (threat indicators), we used receiver operating characteristic curves derived from historical (1938-2007) data for 18 sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) populations in the Fraser River, British Columbia, Canada. We retrospectively determined each population's yearly status (reflected by change in abundance over time) on the basis of each indicator. We then compared that population's status in a given year with the status in subsequent years (determined by the magnitude of decline in abundance across those years). For each sockeye population, we calculated how often each indicator of past status matched subsequent status. No single threat indicator provided error-free estimates of status, but indicators that reflected the extent (i.e., magnitude) of past decline in abundance (through comparison of current abundance with some historical baseline abundance) tended to better reflect status in subsequent years than the rate of decline over the previous 3 generations (a widely used indicator). We recommend that when possible, the reliability of various threat indicators be evaluated with empirical analyses before such indicators are used to determine the need for conservation action. These indicators should include estimates from the entire data set to take into account a historical baseline.},

	abstract = {Bycatch--the incidental catch of nontarget species--is a principal concern in marine conservation and fisheries management. In the eastern Pacific Ocean tuna fishery, a large fraction of nonmammal bycatch is captured by purse-seine gear when nets are deployed around floating objects. We examined the spatial distribution of a dominant species in this fishery's bycatch, the apex predator silky shark (Carcharhinus falciformis), from 1994 to 2005 to determine whether spatial closures, areas where fishing is prohibited, might effectively reduce the bycatch of this species. We then identified candidate locations for fishery closures that specifically considered the trade-off between bycatch reduction and the loss of tuna catch and evaluated ancillary conservation benefits to less commonly captured taxa. Smoothed spatial distributions of silky shark bycatch did not indicate persistent small areas of especially high bycatch for any size class of shark over the 12-year period. Nevertheless, bycatch of small silky sharks ({\textless}90 cm total length) was consistently higher north of the equator during all years. On the basis of this distribution, we evaluated nearly 100 candidate closure areas between 5°N and 15°N that could have reduced, by as much as 33\%, the total silky shark bycatch while compromising only 12\% of the tuna catch. Although silky sharks are the predominant species of elasmobranchs caught as bycatch in this fishery, closures also suggested reductions in the bycatch of other vulnerable taxa, including other shark species and turtles. Our technique provides an effective method with which to balance the costs and benefits of conservation in fisheries management. Spatial closures are a viable management tool, but implementation should be preceded by careful consideration of the consequences of fishing reallocation.},

	abstract = {Understanding the ecological factors that regulate elasmobranch abundance in nearshore waters is essential to effectively manage coastal ecosystems and promote conservation. However, little is known about elasmobranch populations in the western South Atlantic Ocean. An 8-year, standardized longline and drumline survey conducted in nearshore waters off Recife, northeastern Brazil, allowed us to describe the shark assemblage and to monitor abundance dynamics using zero-inflated generalized additive models. This region is mostly used by several carcharhinids and one ginglymostomid, but sphyrnids are also present. Blacknose sharks, Carcharhinus acronotus, were mostly mature individuals and declined in abundance throughout the survey, contrasting with nurse sharks, Ginglymostoma cirratum, which proliferated possibly due to this species being prohibited from all harvest since 2004 in this region. Tiger sharks, Galeocerdo cuvier, were mostly juveniles smaller than 200 cm and seem to use nearshore waters off Recife between January and September. No long-term trend in tiger shark abundance was discernible. Spatial distribution was similar in true coastal species (i.e. blacknose and nurse sharks) whereas tiger sharks were most abundant at the middle continental shelf. The sea surface temperature, tidal amplitude, wind direction, water turbidity, and pluviosity were all selected to predict shark abundance off Recife. Interspecific variability in abundance dynamics across spatiotemporal and environmental gradients suggest that the ecological processes regulating shark abundance are generally independent between species, which could add complexity to multi-species fisheries management frameworks. Yet, further research is warranted to ascertain trends at population levels in the South Atlantic Ocean.},

	abstract = {Despite recent advances in field research on white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) in several regions around the world, opportunistic capture and sighting records remain the primary source of information on this species in the northwest Atlantic Ocean (NWA). Previous studies using limited datasets have suggested a precipitous decline in the abundance of white sharks from this region, but considerable uncertainty in these studies warrants additional investigation. This study builds upon previously published data combined with recent unpublished records and presents a synthesis of 649 confirmed white shark records from the NWA compiled over a 210-year period (1800-2010), resulting in the largest white shark dataset yet compiled from this region. These comprehensive records were used to update our understanding of their seasonal distribution, relative abundance trends, habitat use, and fisheries interactions. All life stages were present in continental shelf waters year-round, but median latitude of white shark occurrence varied seasonally. White sharks primarily occurred between Massachusetts and New Jersey during summer and off Florida during winter, with broad distribution along the coast during spring and fall. The majority of fishing gear interactions occurred with rod and reel, longline, and gillnet gears. Historic abundance trends from multiple sources support a significant decline in white shark abundance in the 1970s and 1980s, but there have been apparent increases in abundance since the 1990s when a variety of conservation measures were implemented. Though the white shark's inherent vulnerability to exploitation warrants continued protections, our results suggest a more optimistic outlook for the recovery of this iconic predator in the Atlantic.},

We used longline surveys to quantify the shark assemblage at French Frigate Shoals (FFS) atoll from May to August 2009. Fishing effort consisted of 189 longline sets totaling 6,862 hook hours of soak time. A total of 221 sharks from 7 species were captured, among which Galapagos (Carcharhinus galapagensis, 36.2\%), gray reef (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos, 25.8\%) and tiger (Galeocerdo cuvier, 20.4\%) sharks were numerically dominant. A lack of blacktip reef sharks (Carcharhinus melanopterus) distinguished the FFS shark assemblage from those at many other atolls in the Indo-Pacific. Compared to prior underwater visual survey estimates, longline methods more accurately represented species abundance and composition for the majority of shark species. Sharks were significantly less abundant in the shallow lagoon than adjacent habitats. Recaptures of Galapagos sharks provided the first empirical estimate of population size for any Galapagos shark population. The overall recapture rate was 5.4\%. Multiple closed population models were evaluated, with Chao M(h) ranking best in model performance and yielding a population estimate of 668 sharks with 95\% confidence intervals ranging from 289-1720. Low shark abundance in the shallow lagoon habitats suggests removal of a small number of sharks from the immediate vicinity of lagoonal islets may reduce short-term predation on endangered monk seal (Monachus schauinslandi) pups, but considerable fishing effort would be required to catch even a small number of sharks. Additional data on long-term movements and habitat use of sharks at FFS are required to better assess the likely ecological impacts of shark culling.},

	abstract = {Since the first investigation 25 years ago, the application of genetic tools to address ecological and evolutionary questions in elasmobranch studies has greatly expanded. Major developments in genetic theory as well as in the availability, cost effectiveness and resolution of genetic markers were instrumental for particularly rapid progress over the last 10 years. Genetic studies of elasmobranchs are of direct importance and have application to fisheries management and conservation issues such as the definition of management units and identification of species from fins. In the future, increased application of the most recent and emerging technologies will enable accelerated genetic data production and the development of new markers at reduced costs, paving the way for a paradigm shift from gene to genome-scale research, and more focus on adaptive rather than just neutral variation. Current literature is reviewed in six fields of elasmobranch molecular genetics relevant to fisheries and conservation management (species identification, phylogeography, philopatry, genetic effective population size, molecular evolutionary rate and emerging methods). Where possible, examples from the Indo-Pacific region, which has been underrepresented in previous reviews, are emphasized within a global perspective.},

	abstract = {The interspecific preferences of fishes for different depths and habitats suggest fishers could avoid unwanted catches of some species while still effectively targeting other species. In pelagic longline fisheries, albacore (Thunnus alalunga) are often caught in relatively cooler, deeper water ({\textgreater}100 m) than many species of conservation concern (e.g., sea turtles, billfishes, and some sharks) that are caught in shallower water ({\textless}100 m). From 2007 to 2011, we examined the depth distributions of hooks for 1154 longline sets (3,406,946 hooks) and recorded captures by hook position on 2642 sets (7,829,498 hooks) in the American Samoa longline fishery. Twenty-three percent of hooks had a settled depth {\textless}100 m. Individuals captured in the 3 shallowest hook positions accounted for 18.3\% of all bycatch. We analyzed hypothetical impacts for 25 of the most abundant species caught in the fishery by eliminating the 3 shallowest hook positions under scenarios with and without redistribution of these hooks to deeper depths. Distributions varied by species: 45.5\% (n = 10) of green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas), 59.5\% (n = 626) of shortbill spearfish (Tetrapturus angustirostris), 37.3\% (n = 435) of silky shark (Carcharhinus falciformis), and 42.6\% (n = 150) of oceanic whitetip shark (C. longimanus) were caught on the 3 shallowest hooks. Eleven percent (n = 20,435) of all tuna and 8.5\% (n = 10,374) of albacore were caught on the 3 shallowest hooks. Hook elimination reduced landed value by 1.6-9.2\%, and redistribution of hooks increased average annual landed value relative to the status quo by 5-11.7\%. Based on these scenarios, redistribution of hooks to deeper depths may provide an economically feasible modification to longline gear that could substantially reduce bycatch for a suite of vulnerable species. Our results suggest that this method may be applicable to deep-set pelagic longline fisheries worldwide.},

	abstract = {The abundance and species richness of the cartilaginous fish community of the continental shelf and slope off central Chile is described, based on fishery-independent trawl tows made in 2006 and 2007. A total of 194,705 specimens comprising 20 species (9 sharks, 10 skates, 1 chimaera) were caught at depths of 100-500 m along a 1,000 km transect between 29.5°S and 39°S. Sample site locations were grouped to represent eight geographical zones within this latitudinal range. Species richness fluctuated from 1 to 6 species per zone. There was no significant latitudinal trend for sharks, but skates showed an increased species richness with latitude. Standardised catch per unit effort (CPUE) increased with increasing depth for sharks, but not for skates, but the observed trend for increasing CPUE with latitude was not significant for either sharks or skates. A change in community composition occurred along the depth gradient with the skates, Psammobatis rudis, Zearaja chilensis and Dipturus trachyderma dominating communities between 100 and 300 m, but small-sized, deep-water dogfishes, such as Centroscyllium spp. dominated the catch between 300 and 500 m. Cluster and ordination analysis identified one widespread assemblage, grouping 58\% of sites, and three shallow-water assemblages. Assemblages with low diversity (coldspots) coincided with highly productive fishing grounds for demersal crustaceans and bony fishes. The community distribution suggested that the differences between assemblages may be due to compensatory changes in mesopredator species abundance, as a consequence of continuous and unselective species removal. Distribution patterns and the quantitative assessment of sharks, skates and chimaeras presented here complement extant biogeographic knowledge and further the understanding of deep-water ecosystem dynamics in relation to fishing activity in the south-east Pacific Ocean.},

	abstract = {Stock synthesis (SS) is a statistical age-structured population modeling framework that has been applied in a wide variety of fish assessments globally. The framework is highly scalable from data-weak situations where it operates as an age-structured production model, to complex situations where it can flexibly incorporate multiple data sources and account for biological and environmental processes. SS implements compensatory population dynamics through use of a function relating mean recruitment to spawner reproductive output. This function enhances the ability of SS to operate in data-weak situations and enables it to estimate fishery management quantities such as fishing rates that would provide for maximum sustainable yield and to employ these rates in forecasts of potential yield and future stock status. Complex model configurations such as multiple areas and multiple growth morphs are possible, tag-recapture data can be used to aid estimation of movement rates among areas, and most parameters can change over time in response to environmental and ecosystem factors. SS is coded using Auto-Differentiation Model Builder, so inherits its powerful capability to efficiently estimate hundreds of parameters using either maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference.

	abstract = {Growing concern for the world's shark and ray populations is driving the need for greater research to inform conservation management. A change in public perception, from one that we need to protect humans from sharks to one where we must protect sharks from humans, has added to calls for better management. The present paper examines the growing need for research for conservation management of sharks and rays by synthesising information presented in this Special Issue from the 2010 Sharks International Conference and by identifying future research needs, including topics such as taxonomy, life history, population status, spatial ecology, environmental effects, ecosystem role and human impacts. However, this biological and ecological research agenda will not be sufficient to fully secure conservation management. There is also a need for research to inform social and economic sustainability. Effective conservation management will be achieved by setting clear priorities for research with the aid of stakeholders, implementing well designed research projects, building the capacity for research, and clearly communicating the results to stakeholders. If this can be achieved, it will assure a future for this iconic group, the ecosystems in which they occur and the human communities that rely on them.},

	abstract = {The majority of global fish stocks lack adequate data to evaluate stock status using conventional stock assessment methods. This poses a challenge for the sustainable management of these stocks. Recent requirements to set scientifically based catch limits in several countries, and growing consumer demand for sustainably managed fish have spurred an emerging field of methods for estimating overfishing thresholds and setting catch limits for stocks with limited data. Using a management strategy evaluation framework we quantified the performance of a number of data-limited methods. For most life-histories, we found that methods that made use of only historical catches often performed worse than maintaining current fishing levels. Only those methods that dynamically accounted for changes in abundance and/or depletion performed well at low stock sizes. Stock assessments that make use of historical catch and effort data did not necessarily out-perform simpler data-limited methods that made use of fewer data. There is a high value of additional information regarding stock depletion, historical fishing effort and current abundance when only catch data are available. We discuss the implications of our results for other data-limited methods and identify future research priorities. © 2013 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Long-distance movements of animals are an important driver of population spatial dynamics and determine the extent of overlap with area-focused human activities, such as fishing. Despite global concerns of declining shark populations, a major limitation in assessments of population trends or spatial management options is the lack of information on their long-term migratory behaviour. For a large marine predator, the tiger shark Galeocerdo cuvier, we show from individuals satellite-tracked for multiple years (up to 1101 days) that adult males undertake annually repeated, round-trip migrations of over 7,500 km in the northwest Atlantic. Notably, these migrations occurred between the highly disparate ecosystems of Caribbean coral reef regions in winter and high latitude oceanic areas in summer, with strong, repeated philopatry to specific overwintering insular habitat. Partial migration also occurred, with smaller, immature individuals displaying reduced migration propensity. Foraging may be a putative motivation for these oceanic migrations, with summer behaviour showing higher path tortuosity at the oceanic range extremes. The predictable migratory patterns and use of highly divergent ecosystems shown by male tiger sharks appear broadly similar to migrations seen in birds, reptiles and mammals, and highlight opportunities for dynamic spatial management and conservation measures of highly mobile sharks.},

	abstract = {Grey reef sharks (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos) can be one of the numerically dominant high order predators on pristine coral reefs, yet their numbers have declined even in the highly regulated Australian Great Barrier Reef (GBR) Marine Park. Knowledge of both large scale and fine scale genetic connectivity of grey reef sharks is essential for their effective management, but no genetic data are yet available. We investigated grey reef shark genetic structure in the GBR across a 1200 km latitudinal gradient, comparing empirical data with models simulating different levels of migration. The empirical data did not reveal any genetic structuring along the entire latitudinal gradient sampled, suggesting regular widespread dispersal and gene flow of the species throughout most of the GBR. Our simulated datasets indicate that even with substantial migrations (up to 25\% of individuals migrating between neighboring reefs) both large scale genetic structure and genotypic spatial autocorrelation at the reef scale were maintained. We suggest that present migration rates therefore exceed this level. These findings have important implications regarding the effectiveness of networks of spatially discontinuous Marine Protected Areas to protect reef sharks.},

	abstract = {The overexploitation of sharks has become a global environmental issue in need of a comprehensive and multifaceted management response. Tracking studies are beginning to elucidate how shark movements shape the internal dynamics and structure of populations, which determine the most appropriate scale of these management efforts. Tracked sharks frequently either remain in a restricted geographic area for an extended period of time (residency) or return to a previously resided-in area after making long-distance movements (site fidelity). Genetic studies have shown that some individuals of certain species preferentially return to their exact birthplaces (natal philopatry) or birth regions (regional philopatry) for either parturition or mating, even though they make long-distance movements that would allow them to breed elsewhere. More than 80 peer-reviewed articles, constituting the majority of published shark tracking and population genetic studies, provide evidence of at least one of these behaviors in a combined 31 shark species from six of the eight extant orders. Residency, site fidelity, and philopatry can alone or in combination structure many coastal shark populations on finer geographic scales than expected based on their potential for dispersal. This information should therefore be used to scale and inform assessment, management, and conservation activities intended to restore depleted shark populations.},

	abstract = {This study presents the longest uninterrupted acoustic monitoring record available to date for the leopard shark Triakis semifasciata, providing novel insight into the fine-scale and long-term movement patterns of this species, and demonstrating that both sexes exhibit site- specific aggregation behavior and seasonal philopatry. Twenty females and 13 males were surgi- cally fitted with coded acoustic transmitters and tracked for over 3 yr by underwater acoustic receivers spanning 120 km of coastline from San Clemente, CA, USA to the USA-Mexico border, with 2 receivers positioned at known aggregation sites in La Jolla and Del Mar, CA. Whereas females appeared to be particularly attracted to the La Jolla site, males exhibited strong site fidelity to Del Mar. Shark abundance at both sites was higher during the day than at night, partic- ularly in late afternoon when water temperature was highest. Female abundance in La Jolla was highest in late June through early December, and was strongly positively correlated with sea sur- face temperature, consistent with the hypothesis that females aggregate in warm water to accel- erate gestation. In addition, seasonal arrival of females to and departure from La Jolla were highly synchronous and coincided with the summer and winter solstices, respectively. In contrast, male abundance in Del Mar was highest in late April through early October and was positively corre- lated with both sea surface temperature and photoperiod. Lastly, both sexes exhibited strong sea- sonal philopatry, with 50.0\% of females and 60.0\% of males returning every year to their respec- tive aggregation sites during the 3 yr study period},

Hydroacoustic surveys across the northeast Newfoundland shelf in 1990, 1995, and 2000 showed the distribution of the remaining large aggregations of cod to be concentrated in inshore embayments, which is contrary to historic patterns. Inshore surveys on the south coast identified local spawning aggregations at specific geographic locations, to which adults homed in subsequent years. Dispersal of eggs and larvae to the offshore occurred during spring, but was localized (within bay) in the warm summer months. Abundance of age-0 cod increased with proximity to spawning location inshore, suggesting self-recruitment within local embayments. Age-2–3 juveniles actively selected structurally complex habitat at scales of less than tens of kilometers, with home ranges typically less than 10ha. Juveniles were associated with specific habitat types, especially at age 0, in both lab and field experiments. Our results suggest that self-recruitment and critical life-history events (e.g., spawning, settlement, and maturity) may occur within local embayments, which currently assume much greater importance to overall cod stock dynamics than in the past. Given evidence for limited dispersal, and the inshore presence of critical habitat for early life-history stages, spatial management tools that consider local dynamics may provide a greater degree of protection for coastal Newfoundland cod than previously thought.},

All sharks sampled from the aggregation site (n = 140) were sexually mature and 97.1 \% were female. Aerial photographs taken during tethered balloon surveys revealed high densities of milling sharks of up to 5470 sharks ha−1. Eight sharks were each tagged with a continuous acoustic transmitter and manually tracked without interruption for up to 48 h. Sharks exhibited strong site-fidelity and were generally confined to a divergence (shadow) zone of low wave energy, which results from wave refraction over the steep bathymetric contours of the submarine canyon. Within this divergence zone, the movements of sharks were strongly localized over the seismically active Rose Canyon Fault. Tracked sharks spent most of their time in shallow water (≤2 m for 71.0 \% and ≤10 m for 95.9 \% of time), with some dispersing to deeper (max: 53.9 m) and cooler (min: 12.7 °C) water after sunset, subsequently returning by sunrise. These findings suggest multiple functions of this aggregation and that the mechanism controlling its formation, maintenance, and dissolution is complex and rooted in the sharks’ variable response to numerous confounding environmental factors},

Residency was high ({\textasciitilde}90\%) in two strata and lower (75\%) in the remaining stratum. The stratum with the highest residency also appeared to experience the highest extraction rate (likely due to a lower population size). These results confirm the existence of differences in movement behaviour within the snapper population, suggesting that localized areas may become depleted regardless of the status of the overall stock. This has consequences for the scale of fisheries management and the size of marine reserves implemented in different regions. U...},

Drivers influencing these fluctuations in abundance of M. alfredi at the site remain uncertain. Based on daily count, behavioural, weather and oceanographic data collected over a three-year period, this study examined the link between the relative number of sightings of manta rays at LEI, the biophysical environment, and the habitat use of individuals around the LEI reef using generalised additive models. The response variable in each of the three generalised additive models was number of sightings (per trip at sea) of cruising, cleaning or foraging M. alfredi. We used a set of eleven temporal, meteorological, biological, oceanographic and lunar predictor variables. Results for cruising, cleaning and foraging M. alfredi explained 27.5\%, 32.8\% and 36.3\% of the deviance observed in the respective models and highlighted five predictors (year, day of year, wind speed, chlorophyll-a concentration and fraction of moon illuminated) as common influences to the three models. There were more manta rays at LEI in autumn and winter, slower wind speeds, higher productivity, and around the new and full moon. The winter peak in sightings of foraging M. alfredi was found to precede peaks in cleaning and cruising activity around the LEI reef, which suggests that enhanced food availability may be a principal driver for this seasonal aggregation. A spatial analysis of behavioural observations highlighted several sites around the LEI reef as 'multi-purpose' areas where cleaning and foraging activities commonly occur, while the southern end of the reef is primarily a foraging area. The use of extensive citizen science datasets, such as those collected by dive operators in this study, is encouraged as they can provide valuable insights into a species' ecology.},

Individuals were present in the study site for long periods, ranging from 8 to 408 days (mean = 185). Size and location of home ranges did not vary over time. A high level of segregation occurred among C. sorrah, with individuals using different types of habitat and showing strong attachment to specific regions. The depth of habitat individuals used varied between sexes. Males tended to use a narrow range of habitat depths within the study site (2·8-6·0 m), whereas females used shallower habitats (1·4-6·2 m) and displayed a seasonal shift in the depth of habitat used. Mean monthly habitat depth used varied by as much as 2 m for females, with individuals using shallower habitats during the winter months. Long-term presence and consistent home ranges suggest that Cleveland Bay provides important habitat for C. sorrah. By defining patterns in the use of nearshore habitats for C. sorrah, this study improves the understanding of the movement and habitat use of smaller-bodied coastal sharks and may help provide guidance for the management of their populations.},

	abstract = {The dusky shark (Carcharhinus obscurus) is the largest member of the genus Carcharhinus and inhabits coastal and pelagic ecosystems circumglobally in temperate, subtropical and tropical marine waters. In the western North Atlantic Ocean (WNA), dusky sharks are overfished and considered vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. As a result, retention of dusky sharks in commercial and recreational fisheries off the east coast of the United States (US) and in the northern Gulf of Mexico is prohibited. Despite the concerns regarding the status of dusky sharks in the WNA, little is known about their habitat utilization. During the summers of 2008-2009, pop-up satellite archival tags were attached to ten dusky sharks (one male, nine females) at a location where they have been observed to aggregate in the north central Gulf of Mexico southwest of the Mississippi River Delta to examine their movement patterns and habitat utilization. All tags successfully transmitted data with deployment durations ranging from 6 to 124 days. Tag data revealed shark movements in excess of 200 km from initial tagging locations, with sharks primarily utilizing offshore waters associated with the continental shelf edge from Desoto Canyon to the Texas/Mexican border. While most sharks remained in US waters, one individual moved from the northern Gulf of Mexico into the Bay of Campeche off the coast of Mexico. Sharks spent 87 \% of their time between 20 and 125 m and 83 \% of their time in waters between 23 and 30 °C. Since dusky sharks are among the most vulnerable shark species to fishing mortality, there is a recovery plan in place for US waters; however, since they have been shown to make long-distance migrations, a multi-national management plan within the WNA may be needed to ensure the successful recovery of this population. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg (outside the USA).},

	abstract = {Quantifying the physiological stress response of chondrichthyans to capture has assisted the development of fishing practices conducive to their survival. However, currently used indicators of stress show significant interspecific and intraspecific variation in species' physiological responses and tolerances to capture. To improve our understanding of chondrichthyan stress physiology and potentially reduce variation when quantifying the stress response, we investigated the use of the adenylate energy charge (AEC); a measure of available metabolic energy. To determine tissues sensitive to metabolic stress, we extracted samples of the brain, heart, liver, white muscle and blood from gummy sharks (Mustelus antarcticus) immediately following gillnet capture and after 3 h recovery under laboratory conditions. Capture caused significant declines in liver, white muscle and blood AEC, whereas no decline was detected in the heart and brain AEC. Following 3 h of recovery from capture, the AEC of the liver and blood returned to "unstressed" levels (control values) whereas white muscle AEC was not significantly different to that immediately after capture. Our results show that the liver is most sensitive to metabolic stress and white muscle offers a practical method to sample animals non-lethally for determination of the AEC. The AEC is a highly informative indicator of stress and unlike current indicators, it can directly measure the change in available energy and thus the metabolic stress experienced by a given tissue. Cellular metabolism is highly conserved across organisms and, therefore, we think the AEC can also provide a standardised form of measuring capture stress in many chondrichthyan species.},

	abstract = {Life-history (age, growth, age validation, reproduction and demography) studies of elasmobranchs date back to the middle of the last century with major early contributions made by British fishery scientists. As predicted by Holden in the early 1970s, many sharks and rays can be vulnerable to fishery mortality because they grow slowly, mature late in life, reproduce infrequently, have relatively low fecundities and can have relatively long life spans. As has now been found, however, not all species exhibit these traits. Also, ageing structures (neural arches and caudal thorns), other than vertebrae and spines, have since been evaluated. Various methods for validating age and growth estimates have been developed and tested on numerous species of elasmobranchs. These include tag-recapture analyses, oxytetracycline injections, centrum or spine edge and marginal increment analyses, and bomb radiocarbon dating of calcified structures. Application of these techniques has sometimes not only validated relatively slow growth and long life span estimates, but also has produced other results. A brief historical perspective on the applications and limitations of these techniques for elasmobranchs is provided, along with a discussion of selected species for which these techniques worked well, did not work at all or have produced variable and conflicting results. Because many fishery management techniques utilize age or stage-specific information, often through demographic analyses, accurate information on the life histories of fished populations, especially age validation, is extremely important for the fishery management of these cartilaginous fishes.},

We suggest that catch actually peaked at 130 million tonnes, and has been declining much more strongly since. This decline in reconstructed catches reflects declines in industrial catches and to a smaller extent declining discards, despite industrial fishing having expanded from industrialized countries to the waters of developing countries.

The offshore-migrating fish overwintered in deep Laurentian Channel waters, returning inshore in April. Individual migration routes and migration timing were variable, indicating that the cod did not aggregate in large schools during the seasonal migration events.},

Despite several descriptions of how shark species use nursery areas and what types of regions nurseries may be found in, no explicit definition of what constitutes a shark nursery area has been presented. Here we evaluate the assumptions of the current shark nursery paradigm in light of available data. Based on examination of these assumptions and available methods of quantifying and accurately describing shark nursery areas, a new more quantitative definition of shark nursery areas is proposed. This def- inition requires 3 criteria to be met for an area to be identified as a nursery: (1) sharks are more com- monly encountered in the area than other areas; (2) sharks have a tendency to remain or return for extended periods; and (3) the area or habitat is repeatedly used across years. These criteria make the definition of shark nursery areas more compatible with those for other aquatic species. The improved definition of this concept will provide more valuable information for fisheries managers and shark biologists.},

	abstract = {The first large systematic collection of benthic invertebrate megafauna from the Australian continental margin (depths {\textgreater} 100 m) revealed high species richness and novelty on the south-western continental slope ( 100–1100 m depth; 18 S–35 S). A total of 1979 morphologically defined species was discriminated in seven taxa across all samples: Demospongiae, Decapoda, corals (Octocorallia and Antipatharia), Mollusca, Echinodermata, Ascidiacea, and Pycnogonida. Collectively, 59\% were estimated to be new or unnamed species. The distribution pattern of megafaunal communities, analysed with a suite of 17 physical covariates, was most influenced at large spatial scales ({\textgreater}100s km) by bottom temperature, oxygen concentration and latitude, whereas at smaller scales (10s of km), seabed type was most influential. Many covariates are driven by the same physical processes and are correlated (e.g. to depth or latitude), thus it is not possible to ascribe causal relationships to fauna distributions. However, their identification highlights the spatial scales that determine the composition of megafaunal communities. Regional-scale transitions in bottom temperature and oxygen concentration are determined by water masses and currents that interact with the south-western margin seabed in different ways depending on location. The nested, smaller-scale heterogeneity of seabed type, classified simply as ‘hard’ or ‘soft’ terrain, differentiates consolidated attachment sites for sessile fauna from sediments suited to mobile and burrowing fauna. Different physical factors affect the distribution of benthic fauna at different scales. Collectively, these patterns of heterogeneity can be represented in a hierarchical framework that consists of biogeographic provinces, biomes, biogeomorphic features, terrains, and finer scales. The Australian government is using a hierarchical approach to identify bioregions for management purposes; a key aim is to ensure that a National Representative System of Marine Protected Areas (NRSMPA) will meet the requirement of comprehensiveness, adequacy and representativeness. Important findings from this study are that the provincial structure of invertebrate megabenthos broadly aligns with the provincial structure derived earlier from the distribution of fishes, but there are differences in the distribution of individual major taxa at both provincial and megahabitat scales. Representative coverage of rarer taxa or narrowly distributed taxa might not be feasible at the same time as ensuring main fauna groups are adequately represented. The hierarchical scales of heterogeneity of the megabenthos in this area, the differences between taxa, and the high proportion of apparently rare species make it clear that it will be as important to manage the area outside the NRSMPA as to manage the NRSMPA itself. Management will be required at different scales that correspond to the multiscale spatial heterogeneity of continental margin fauna.},

However, little is known about the spatial and temporal scales of their habitat use and associated ecological role. In this study, we employed passive acoustic telemetry to investigate the residency patterns and migration dynamics of 18 adult bull sharks (195–283 cm total length) tagged in southern Mozambique for a period of between 10 and 22 months. The majority of sharks (n = 16) exhibited temporally and spatially variable residency patterns interspersed with migration events. Ten individuals undertook coastal migrations that ranged between 433 and 709 km (mean = 533 km) with eight of these sharks returning to the study site. During migration, individuals exhibited rates of movement between 2 and 59 km.d$^{\textrm{−1}}$ (mean = 17.58 km.d$^{\textrm{−1}}$) and were recorded travelling annual distances of between 450 and 3760 km (mean = 1163 km). Migration towards lower latitudes primarily took place in austral spring and winter and there was a significant negative correlation between residency and mean monthly sea temperature at the study site. This suggested that seasonal change is the primary driver behind migration events but further investigation is required to assess how foraging and reproductive activity may influence residency patterns and migration. Results from this study highlight the need for further understanding of bull shark migration dynamics and suggest that effective conservation strategies for this vulnerable species necessitate the incorporation of congruent trans-boundary policies over large spatial scales.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The first survey of the continental-slope demersal fish fauna off the west coast of Australia - the region between latitudes 20 to 35 degrees S in depths from similar to 200 to 1500 m-was undertaken in 1991. Most species were caught rarely and only 14 species were represented by {\textgreater}1\% of individuals in the total catch. Collectively, the catches were dominated numerically by the Acropomatidae and Chlorophthalmidae at shelf-break and upper slope depths (similar to 200 to 600 m), and the Macrouridae, Bathygadidae, Synaphobranchidae, Alepocephalidae and Oreosomatidae at greater depths. Overall, the Macrouridae was both the most abundant and most species-rich family. The fauna appears to be richer (388 species from 109 families) than the slope faunas of the more intensively sampled North Atlantic and northern Pacific; its richness may be attributable to the overlap of ancient and extensive Indo-West Pacific and temperate Australasian faunas that extend from shelf to mid-slope depths. These faunas are maintained in the region by a variety of near-surface and intermediate-depth ocean currents that bathe the western slope. Seven distinct fish community types were defined by bathymetric and latitudinal boundaries: a northern and a southern shelf-break community; 2 depth-stratified communities on the upper-slope, and 3 communities defined by depth and latitude on the mid-slope. Ecotones between these communities at the 250 to 350 m and 700 to 800 m depth intervals coincide, respectively, with the lower Limits of the near-surface Leeuwin Current and the upper extent of Antarctic Intermediate Water. The composition of the mid-slope fauna in the southern part of the study area suggests it is part of a wide-ranging Australasian mid-slope community shared with the Great Australian Eight, southeastern Australia and New Zealand. There is progressive replacement by a northern fauna at all depths as latitude decreases along the west coast. The western slope fauna is characterised by low density as well as high diversity. Fish density was estimated to be several times lower than on the continental slope off southeastern Australia, and also lower than North Atlantic and northern Pacific slope regions. Low density is Likely to be related to low overlying productivity due to the absence of upwelling associated with the near-surface, southward-flowing Leeuwin Current. Low overlying productivity also appears to be linked to the ecological composition of the demersal fauna; it is characterised by many relatively small, benthic species, non-vertically migrating species, and a lack of aggregated large commercial fishes},

The mean annual catch was 256 sharks (SD = 107.5, range 129–571). There was no significant linear trend in catch rate with time. Of the total C. obscurus catch, 677 (12\%) were found alive and 217 of these (3.8\%) were tagged and released. Only three tagged animals were recaptured. The size frequency distribution of the catch was trimodal, the modes of each sex consisting of small (mostly neonate), medium (adolescent) and large (mostly mature) sharks respectively. Geographical and seasonal distributions were characteristic for each of these size categories. Females significantly outnumbered males in all size categories, the greatest disparity (2.72:1) being in large animals. This probably reflects the movement inshore of near-term pregnant females to drop their pups. On 128 occasions, groups of five or more sharks were found together in a net installation, the largest group consisting of 113 animals. Group catches tended to coincide with the annual 'sardine run', a seasonal influx of Sardinops sagax. The sardine run affects the distribution of medium and large sharks. Few animals were sampled in mating condition and there were few newly pregnant or midterm females, but there are indications that the gestation period may be as much as two years. Teleosts dominated the diet in terms of frequency of occurrence (63\%) and elasmobranchs in terms of mass (51.4\%).},

In the face of these declines, identification of nursery areas for this species is of particular importance to ensure the implementation of protective measures that will maximize survival of young individuals to maturity. Passive acoustic telemetry was used to assess the emergence of Plymouth, Kingston, Duxbury (PKD) Bay, Massachusetts, USA, as a seasonal nursery for juvenile sand tigers that migrate north from southern parturition grounds. Seasonal residency, habitat use, and site fidelity of 73 acoustically tagged juvenile sand tigers (78 to 108 cm fork length) were monitored within PKD Bay during 4 seasonal periods from 2008 to 2011. Eight individuals were tracked in multiple years, with 2 individuals returning to PKD Bay in 3 consecutive years. Sand tigers remained in PKD Bay for periods of 1 to 124 d and displayed a high degree of site fidelity to 2 core habitats during each year of the study. Weekly activity space estimates were relatively constant throughout each yearly monitoring period, with a general increase prior to emigration of sharks from the embayment. Emigration of sharks from PKD Bay was significantly related to both day length and water temperature. Collectively, these results suggest that PKD Bay constitutes a seasonal nursery area for juvenile sand tigers and warrants the extension of juvenile sand tiger essential fish habitat north of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA.},

	abstract = {One of the major unresolved questions of diadromous fishes is how they evolved. In this paper, several issues in the evolution of diadromy are examined from the viewpoint of life history theory. The paper opens with a discussion of whether it is appropriate to use the term "strategy" in describing the biology of diadromous fishes since there is little evidence that diadromy arose through frequency-dependent intraspecific competition . Next, a comparison between diadromous and nondiadromous species reveals a similarity in their life history traits including egg size, fecundity, age at first maturity, and body size. Even comparisons between diadromous and nondiadromous populations within species reveal life history differences. Thus, identification of fishes as "diadromous" is a subjective rather than an evolutionary classification. Third, one of the key questions for diadromy - when does natural selection favor habitat switching? - is addressed. The question is resolved through a life history model showing how natural selection operates on each component of a diadromous life cycle. To evolve, migration must maximize fitness or the lifetime product of reproductive success × survivorship. Diadromy, therefore, occurs when the gain in fitness from staying in only one habitat. The most important biological variable in explaining the presence and direction of diadromous migration is apparently the relative availability of food in sea and freshwater habitats. Since seas are often more productive than fresh waters in the temperate zone, while the reserve occurs in the tropics, both anadromy and catadromy can evolve. Finally, amphidromy is hypothesized to be an ancestral state in the evolution of anadromy and catadromy. Amphidromy will be evolutionary stable, however, if there is insufficient advantage to completing adult development in a second habitat. This and future studies of life history evolution can provide much insight into the biology and effective management of diadromous fishes.},

	abstract = {Capture-mark-recapture models are useful tools for estimating demographic parameters but often result in low precision when recapture rates are low. Low recapture rates are typical in many study systems including fishing-based studies. Incorporating auxiliary data into the models can improve precision and in some cases enable parameter estimation. Here, we present a novel application of acoustic telemetry for the estimation of apparent survival and abundance within capture-mark-recapture analysis using open population models. Our case study is based on simultaneously collecting longline fishing and acoustic telemetry data for a large mobile apex predator, the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorhynchus cepedianus), at a coastal site in Tasmania, Australia. Cormack-Jolly-Seber models showed that longline data alone had very low recapture rates while acoustic telemetry data for the same time period resulted in at least tenfold higher recapture rates. The apparent survival estimates were similar for the two datasets but the acoustic telemetry data showed much greater precision and enabled apparent survival parameter estimation for one dataset, which was inestimable using fishing data alone. Combined acoustic telemetry and longline data were incorporated into Jolly-Seber models using a Monte Carlo simulation approach. Abundance estimates were comparable to those with longline data only; however, the inclusion of acoustic telemetry data increased precision in the estimates. We conclude that acoustic telemetry is a useful tool for incorporating in capture-mark-recapture studies in the marine environment. Future studies should consider the application of acoustic telemetry within this framework when setting up the study design and sampling program.},

In this paper, what is known about the causes and consequences of partial migration in fishes is reviewed. Firstly, the ultimate and proximate drivers of partial migration are reflected upon: what ecological factors can shape the evolution of migratory dimorphism? How is partial migration maintained over evolutionary timescales? What proximate mechanisms determine whether an individual is migratory or remains resident? Following this, the consequences of partial migration are considered, in an ecological and evolutionary context, and also in an applied sense. Here it is argued that understanding the concept of partial migration is crucial for fisheries and ecosystem managers, and can provide information for conservation strategies. The review concludes with a reflection on the future opportunities in this field, and the avenues of research that are likely to be fruitful to shed light on the enduring puzzle of partial migration in fishes.},

	abstract = {Migration, the seasonal movement of individuals among different locations, is a behavior found throughout the animal kingdom. Although migration is widely studied at taxonomically restricted levels, cross-taxonomic syntheses of migration are less common. As a result, we lack answers to broad questions such as what ultimate factors generally drive animal migration. Here we present such a synthesis by using a spatially explicit, individual-based model in which we evolve behavior rules via simulations under a wide range of ecological conditions to answer two questions. First, under what types of ecological conditions can an individual maximize its fitness by migrating (vs. being a resident)? Second, what types of information do individuals use to guide their movement? We show that migration is selected for when resource distributions are dominated more by seasonality than by local patchiness, and residency (nonmigratory behavior) is selected for when the reverse is true. When selected for, migration evolves as both a movement behavior and an information usage strategy. We also find that different types of migration can evolve, depending on the ecological conditions and availability of information. Finally, we present empirical support for our main results, drawn from migration patterns exhibited by a variety of taxonomic groups.},

	abstract = {During the past century, the field of fisheries oceanography has dominated the study of population connectivity in marine environments. The influence of physical and biological processes and their relationship to transport and retention of early life history stages has been central in providing insight into population structuring and connectivity. However, the focus on dispersive early life history stages has meant that the role of adults has received less attention and is not fully understood or appreciated. We argue that adults play a vital role in population connectivity for a wide range of marine taxa and hypothesize that adult-mediated population connectivity commonly results in a diverse array of population structuring. Two case-studies on winter skate, Leucoraja ocellata, and winter flounder, Pseudopleuronectes americanus, are presented to illustrate the role adults play in marine connectivity at both broad and fine scales, respectively. Indeed, if adults are important for population connectivity, we argue that the role of larval processes is conditional on adult choice and only management and research pursuits that integrate the full life cycle of species will capture the full dynamics of metapopulation connectivity. Failure to include the roles of adults can lead to misinterpretation of the causes and consequences of changes in ecosystem structure and fisheries productivity.},

We suggest that this small-scale fishing has arisen because of long-term fisheries over-exploitation in South East Asia. This IUU fishing forms part of the expansion-and-displacement cycle that can rapidly reduce biomass and alter the trophic structure of local ecosystems. With increasing human populations in the region, the pressure to fish illegally is likely to increase. Regional responses are required to deter and monitor the illegal over-exploitation of fisheries resources, which is critical to secure ecosystem stability as climate change and other destructive human activities threaten food security.},

	abstract = {For stocks which are considered "data-poor" no knowledge exist about growth, mortality or recruitment. The only available information is from catches. Here we examine the ability to assess the level of exploitation of a data-poor stock based only on information of the size of individuals in catches. The model is a formulation of the classic Beverton-Holt theory in terms of size where stock parameters describing growth, natural mortality, recruitment, etc. are determined from life-history invariants. A simulation study was used to compare the reliability of assessments performed under different information availability scenarios, from data-limited, where none of the parameters are known beforehand, to different degrees of information availability cases where one or more parameters are known. If no parameters are known it is possible to correctly assess whether the fishing mortality is below F{\textless}inf{\textgreater}msy{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} in more than 60\% of the cases, and almost always correctly assess whether a stock is subject to overfishing. Adding information about age, i.e., assuming that growth rate and asymptotic size are known, does not improve the estimation. Only knowledge of the ratio between mortality and growth led to a considerable improvement in the assessment. Overall, the simulation study demonstrates that it may be possible to classify a data-poor stock as undergoing over- or under-fishing, while the exact status, i.e., how much the fishing mortality is above or below F{\textless}inf{\textgreater}msy{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, can only be assessed with a substantial uncertainty. Limitations of the approach are discussed.},

The methodology is applied to tag recapture data for white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) collected in the recreational fishery and the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Ocean's test fishery at Albion in the lower Fraser River. Significant differences were found between some estimated movement rates by season and length class, supporting the notion of there being marked differences in seasonal movement patterns between different life history stages of A. transmontanus in the lower Fraser River. Uncertainty in the tag reporting rate parameter, quantified using a recreational creel sampling program, is summarized by a prior distribution. The utility of recreational fishing effort as a model covariate in accounting for seasonal and spatial variation in recapture rates is addressed using Bayesian model evaluation criteria. The data provide strong support in favour of models that include fishing effort as a covariate. The appropriate level of stratification for the recreational catchability parameter q is assessed using Bayesian model evaluation criteria; models in which q is estimated by season and length class have the highest posterior probabilities.},

	abstract = {A basic step in understanding the dynamics of a fish population is to quantify movement and mortality rates. Conventional mark–recapture experiments have provided the foundation for studies on animal movement, particularly for fish. Previous studies have shown rapid mixing of sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) among fishery regulatory areas, with the pattern of movement related to fish size. Over 300 000 tag releases in Alaska and over 27 000 tag recoveries from 1979 to 2009 were analyzed. We used a Markov model to quantify annual movement probabilities among areas for three size groups of sablefish. The negative-binomial likelihood was used to model the tag-recovery data because of significant overdispersion. Annual move- ment probabilities were high, ranging from 10\% to 88\% depending on area of occupancy at each time step and size group. Overall, movement probabilities were very different between areas of occupancy and moderately different between size groups. Esti- mated annual movement of small sablefish from the central Gulf of Alaska had the reverse pattern of a previous study, with 29\% moving westward and 39\% moving eastward. Movement probabilities also varied annually, with decreasing movement until the late 1990s and increasing movement until 2009. Year-specific magnitude in movement probability of large fish was highly negatively correlated with female spawning biomass estimates from the federal stock assessment. Mean mortality estimates from time at liberty were similar to the federal stock assessment. Incorporating these tag-recovery and movement data into a fully age-structured spatial stock assessment model will inform harvest apportionment strategies to conserve spawning biomass and maximize future yields.},

	abstract = {The statistical analysis of mark-recapture-recovery (MRR) data dates back to the 1960s, when the foundation was laid for stochastic models, fitted to data by the method of maximum likelihood. There have been a number of developments which have proved to be extremely influential. Two of these are: the extension of MRR data and modelling to multi-site inference, and the integrated modelling of single-site MRR and census data. The aim of this study is to unite these two independent research programs, in order to enable effective integrated analysis of multi-site MRR data and multi-site census data. Census data can be described by a state-space model, and the likelihood is formed using the Kalman filter. By making use of movement information provided by MRR data, it is possible to avoid flat likelihood surfaces, thus allowing estimation of site-dependent parameters. This increases the precision of dispersal parameters and allows estimation of parameters inestimable from MRR studies alone. This paper extends research within the area of integrated population analysis by developing methods for analysing multi-site census data coupled with multi-site capture recapture data. The methodology is explored using a simulated data set, the structure of which is motivated by a dataset of Great cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis).},

Their views, knowledge, and cooperation are vital for a successful implementation of the regulation.

Linear regression models were fitted to daily logbook data from a multispecies penaeid trawl fishery in which within-vessel changes in effi- ciency are common. Two model-fitting strategies were compared. The predictive strategy focused on maximizing the explained var- iance, and the estimation strategy on finding realistic coefficients for important components of changing catchability. Realistic values could not always be obtained, because the regression factors were not orthogonal, and data on the presence of technology were some- times unreliable or systematically incomplete. It was not possible to separate fishing power from abundance by analysing logbook data alone; it was necessary to incorporate external information within the standardization model. Therefore, the resultant estimation models incorporated external information and expert knowledge by offsets. There was no single best estimation model. Instead, a series of models provided an envelope of possible changes in relative fishing power and prawn abundance since 1970. Compared with the prediction models, the estimation models revealed different trends in relative fishing power and relative abundance.},

A key feature of the boral package is the ability to incorporate latent variables as a parsimonious method of modelling between species correlation. Pure latent variable models offer a model-based approach to unconstrained ordination, for visualizing sites and the indicator species characterizing them on a low-dimensional plot. Correlated response models consist of fitting generalized linear models to each species, while including latent variables to account for residual correlation between species, for example, due to unmeasured covariates.},

Fisheries can impact large predator abundance directly through targeted capture and indirectly through incidental capture of nontarget species or bycatch. However, measures of the global nature of bycatch are lacking for air-breathing megafauna. We fill this knowledge gap and present a synoptic global assessment of the distribution and intensity of bycatch of seabirds, marine mammals, and sea turtles based on empirical data from the three most commonly used types of fishing gears worldwide. We identify taxa-specific hotspots of bycatch intensity and find evidence of cumulative impacts across fishing fleets and gears. This global map of bycatch illustrates where data are particularly scarce--in coastal and small-scale fisheries and ocean regions that support developed industrial fisheries and millions of small-scale fishers--and identifies fishing areas where, given the evidence of cumulative hotspots across gear and taxa, traditional species or gear-specific bycatch management and mitigation efforts may be necessary but not sufficient. Given the global distribution of bycatch and the mitigation success achieved by some fleets, the reduction of air-breathing megafauna bycatch is both an urgent and achievable conservation priority.},

	abstract = {A variety of data types can be included in contemporary integrated stock assessments to simultaneously provide information on all estimated parameters. Conflicts between data, which are often a symptom of model misspecification and evident as model misfit, can affect the estimates of important parameters and derived quantities. Unfortunately, there are few standard diagnostic tools available for integrated stock assessment models that can provide the analyst with all the information needed to determine if there is substantial model misspecification. In this study, we use simulation methods to evaluate the ability of commonly-used and recently-proposed diagnostic tests to detect model misspecification in the observation model process (i.e., the incorrect form for survey selectivity), systems dynamics (i.e., incorrect assumed values for steepness of the stock-recruitment relationship and natural mortality), and incorrect data weighting. The diagnostic tests evaluated here were: i) residuals analysis (SDNR and runs test); ii) retrospective analysis; iii) the R0 likelihood component profile; iv) the age-structured production model (ASPM); and v) catch-curve analysis (CCA). The efficacy of the diagnostic tests depended on whether the misspecification was in the observation or systems dynamics model. Residual analyses were easily the best detector of misspecification of the observation model while the ASPM test was the only good diagnostic for detecting misspecification of system dynamics model. Retrospective analysis and the R0 likelihood component profile infrequently detected misspecified models, and CCA had a high probability of rejecting correctly-specified models. Finally, applying multiple carefully selected diagnostics can increase the power to detect misspecification without substantially increasing the probability of falsely concluding there is misspecification when the model is correctly specified.},

We tracked 10 adult female loggerhead turtles Caretta caretta from Masirah Island, Sultanate of Oman, which hosts one of the world's largest breeding aggregations. Transmitters were specifically deployed early in the nesting season to enable tracking throughout the internesting and post-nesting habitats. Turtles displayed a dichotomy in behaviour during the internesting period, with 6 remaining close to Masirah Island and the others undertaking circuitous oceanic loops, hundreds of kilometres in length. This behaviour did not appear to be related to body size. Tracking-derived minimum clutch frequency was on average (+/- SD) 4.8 +/- 1.2 nests (n = 8 ind.). Post-nesting migrations revealed a propensity towards long-term utilisation of oceanic habitats in the region between Socotra Island (Yemen) and the mainland of Yemen/Oman, with 76 +/- 15.4\% of time spent in oceanic habitat (n = 8 ind.). The spatial footprint of our tracked turtles was found to be far less than that of a similar number of turtles that were tagged later in the same season (from a separate unpublished study) and from long-distance returns of flipper tags. The spatial and temporal sub-structuring of the population highlights the need for more comprehensive tracking projects, with deployments across the breeding season in multiple years, in order to obtain reliable estimations of high-use foraging habitats of widely dispersed marine vertebrates. Variation in behaviour patterns suggests the need for diverse conservation measures.},

Such spatial dynamics are poorly understood for pelagic sharks despite the decline of many species due to overfishing. Satellite-linked archival transmitters were used to record the movements of blue sharks Prionace glauca for the first time in the northeast Atlantic. A total of 256 tracking days were recorded, with sharks covering an estimated minimum distance of 11 432 km. Generally, blue sharks displayed wide-ranging southward movements away from the tagging areas (English Channel, southern Portugal and the Azores Islands), with juvenile sharks displaying less site fidelity than previously suggested from other methods. Vertical movements ranged from the surface to a maximum depth of 696 m, and water temperatures varied from 10.6 to 24.6°C. Shifts in both thermal and depth-use patterns were detected, with tracked sharks displaying behavioural variability correlated with the environment, both within and between individuals. Patterns of behaviour in coastal areas were generally linked to the thermal structure of the water column; sharks displayed some preference for surface layers in thermally stratified waters, but displayed less regular behaviour in wellmixed or weakly stratified waters. In offshore locations, sharks usually adopted either a surfaceoriented or a depth-oriented diving pattern, often switching between both in response to probable changes in prey distribution or prey type when in deeper water. Fishing-induced mortality of tracked sharks was approximately 10\% during the period of 13 to 70 d post-tagging. Our results indicate a variety of short and longer range movements of juvenile and sub-adult blue sharks with respect to time and environment in the northeast Atlantic, which suggests complex spatial dynamics and population structuring in this exploited species.},

Methods for delimiting stocks have advanced considerably over recent years, including genetic, telemetric, tagging, geochemical and phenotypic information. In parallel with these developments, concepts in population ecology such as meta-population dynamics and connectivity have advanced. The pragmatic view of stocks has always accepted some mixing during spawning, feeding and/or larval drift. Here we consider the mismatch between ecological connectivity of a matrix of populations typically focussed on demographic measurements, and genetic connectivity of populations that focus on genetic exchange detected using modern molecular approaches. We suggest that from an ecological-connectivity perspective populations can be delimited as management units if there is limited exchange during recruitment or via migration in most years. From a genetic-connectivity perspective such limited exchange can maintain panmixia. We use case-studies of species endangered by overexploitation and/or habitat degradation to show how current methods of stock delimitation can help in managing populations and in conservation.},

Reliable catch information at the species level was available for the period 1978–2003. Trends in catch rate and size were used to assess the population status of 14 commonly caught shark species. In addition, a demographic modelling approach was used in conjunction with the catch information to assess the potential effect of the nets on populations. Catch rates of four species (Carcharhinus leucas, C. limbatus, Sphyrna lewini and S. mokarran) showed a significant decline, as did the mean or median length of three species (Carcharhinus amboinensis, C. limbatus and female Carcharodon carcharias). For three species that showed declining catch rates or length the potential effect of the shark nets was assessed to be low, suggesting that other sources of catch were responsible for the declining status. The potential effect of the shark nets was assessed to be high for two species (Carcharhinus obscurus and Carcharias taurus, neither of which showed declines in catch rate or length), because of very low intrinsic rates of population increase},

	abstract = {Understanding the habitat preferences of large marine vertebrates has only recently become tractable with the widespread availability of satellite telemetry for monitoring movements and behaviour. For many species with low population abundances, however, little progress has been made in identifying space use patterns. The endothermic porbeagle shark, Lamna nasus, has declined in the North Atlantic due to severe fishing pressure, with little evidence of recovery. One potential factor exacerbating population decline is area fidelity to coastal waters where fisheries are intensive. We tested for short-term area fidelity by attaching pop-up satellite-linked archival transmitters to four porbeagles in summer 2007, resulting in 175�days total tracking time covering an estimated 10,256�km distance. Throughout July and August the sharks occupied localised areas (8,602 - 90,153�km2) within the Celtic Sea, between the south-west UK, south-west Wales and southern Ireland. Only one shark was tracked into the autumn, when it moved into deep water off the continental shelf, then north towards colder latitudes. Sharks occupied a broad vertical depth range (0 - 552�m) and water temperatures (9� - 19��C). Dives were made frequently from the surface to near the seabed in shelf areas, however, in shelf edge habitats extended periods of time were spent at depths {\textgreater}�300�m. Porbeagles showed considerable plasticity in diel depth changes within and between individuals and as a function of habitat type. In addition to no obvious day-night difference in depth occupation, some sharks showed reverse diel vertical migration (DVM) (dawn ascent - dusk descent) in well-mixed coastal waters whereas normal DVM (dawn descent - dusk ascent) characterised movements into deeper, thermally well-stratified waters. The variable behaviours may reflect the need for different search strategies depending on habitat and prey types encountered. These results show porbeagles are potentially vulnerable to fisheries throughout the summer when they aggregate, and that large scale movement across national boundaries identifies the need for international conservation measures},

	abstract = {The problem of overexploitation and unsustainability is a major issue in global fisheries. Marine reserves or protected no-take zones have been suggested as a possible solution that would maintain yield and protect stocks indefinitely. A key factor in the effectiveness of a marine reserve-fishery system is the rate of exchange of biomass between reserve and fishery: if the rate of exchange is too low then the fishery is not viable, but if the rate of exchange is too high then stocks may be exploited unsustainably and the reserve is rendered ineffective. The rate of exchange is determined by both the physical design and shape of the reserve, and the movement and dispersal behaviour of both the adult and larval-stage fish. Previous models looking at optimal reserve design usually only consider a diffusive population scale movement and dispersal, even though most animal movement is more realistically modelled as being correlated at the individual level. In this article, a deliberately simple simulation of a theoretical marine reserve-fishery system is used to demonstrate the danger of making predictions using only a population-level simplistic diffusive movement model. Further predictions based on the population average of a more realistic correlated movement model are also shown to be inaccurate. This result is due to both the high levels of individual variability in movement behaviour, and the heterogeneity of the environment. This suggests that in future studies, individual-based (rather than population-level) simulations and models are likely to give more useful insights into the dynamics of the marine fishery environment},

However, vertebrae are part of the shark's axial skeleton, and band deposition may stop in old sharks when somatic growth ceases. We aged vertebral sections from New Zealand porbeagle sharks (Lamna nasus) under reflected white light and using X-radiographs. Bomb radiocarbon assays supported vertebral age estimates up to  ̃20 years, but not at older ages. The results suggest that older porbeagles were under-aged by as much as 50\% from vertebral band counts, presumably because band width declined to a point where it became unresolvable. This has important implications for growth studies on other long-lived sharks. Estimated ages at sexual maturity were 8–11 years for males and 15–18 years for females, and longevity may be  ̃65 years. New Zealand and North Atlantic porbeagles differ in these parameters, and in length at maturity and maximum length, suggesting genetic isolation of the two populations},

	abstract = {The whiskery shark, Furgaleus macki, is important in the commercial shark fishery off southern Western Australia. The reproductive biology was studied with the aid of 88 specimens collected by commercial gill-net vessels off south-western Australia between March 1994 and August 1996. The size selectivity of the gill-nets resulted in only mature and large juvenile specimens being caught. Size at birth was estimated to be 22–27 cm total length. Size (fork length) at maturity was 107 cm for males and 112 cm for females. There is a seasonal reproductive cycle. Mating is most likely to occur from August to September, with females storing spermatozoa until ovulation in late January to early April. Gestation lasts 7–9 months, with parturition from August to October. Litter sizes vary from 4 to 28 (mean 19). There was a significant linear relationship between litter size and maternal length. Mature males mate each year, but females produce litters every second year. Mature non-pregnant females develop large yolky ova from March to October, with development of the ova completed several months before ovulation. The results are compared with previous records and with data for other species of the family Triakidae that occur off southern Australia},

Results of these studies are biased if tags are not retained permanently and if tag loss is not taken into account. In this paper, we develop a simple tag shedding model to account for the effects of time at liberty, sex, and other factors and use one of its special cases to estimate the instantaneous tag shedding rate from data based on two double-tagging experiments on the school shark, Galeorhinus galeus, and gummy shark, Mustelus antarcticus, off southern Australia. For either species, tag shedding rate could vary with tag type, position of tag on fish, and sex of fish, but not with length at release or time at liberty. The shedding rate of Petersen disc fin tags was well above 50\%/yr. Dart tags were shed at a higher rate (41\%/yr for school shark; 63\%/yr for gummy shark) than either "Roto" or "Jumbo" fin tags (8\%/yr for school shark; 6\%/yr for gummy shark). For either species of shark, the shedding rate of dart tags anchored in the basal cartilage of the dorsal fin was about half that of dart tags anchored in the dorsal musculature.},

	abstract = {Summary Marine ecosystems are suffering severe depletion of apex predators worldwide [1–4]; shark declines are principally due to conservative life-histories and fisheries overexploitation [5–8]. On coral reefs, sharks are strongly interacting apex predators and play-�a key role in maintaining healthy reef ecosystems [9–11]. Despite increasing fishing pressure, reef shark catches are rarely subject to specific limits, with management approaches typically depending upon no-take marine reserves to maintain populations [12–14]. Here, we reveal that this approach is failing by documenting an ongoing collapse in two of the most abundant reef shark species on the Great Barrier Reef (Australia). We find an order of magnitude fewer sharks on fished reefs compared to no-entry management zones that encompass only 1\% of reefs. No-take zones, which are more difficult to enforce than no-entry zones, offer almost no protection for shark populations. Population viability models of whitetip and gray reef sharks project ongoing steep declines in abundance of 7\% and 17\% per annum, respectively. These findings indicate that current management of no-take areas is inadequate for protecting reef sharks, even in one of the world's most-well-managed reef ecosystems. Further steps are urgently required for protecting this critical functional group from ecological extinction},

	abstract = {New Zealand's shark fisheries have increased steadily since 1975 to reach 17 000-19 000 t per year. Commercial fisheries catch mainly spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias), school shark (Galeorhinus galeus), skates (Raja nasuta and R. innominata), ghost sharks (Hydrolagus novaezealandiae and Hydrolagus sp.), rig (Mustelus lenticulatus) and elephantfish (Callorhinchus milii). School shark, rig and elephantfish fisheries have long histories, and catches are limited by Individual Transferable Quotas. Fisheries for spiny dogfish, skates and ghost sharks have only developed since 1979. Spiny dogfish and skate landings are partially regulated by total quotas. Other sharks are prohibited target species. Blue (Prionace glauca), porbeagle (Lamna nasus) and mako (Isurus oxyrinchus) sharks are taken as by-catch of the tuna longline fishery. There is a small recreational catch of spiny dogfish, school shark, rig, mako shark and blue shark. Historically important Maori fisheries for spiny dogfish, school shark and rig are now minor. A beach netting programme has operated off Dunedin beaches since 1969 to protect swimmers from shark attacks. Fisheries management measures include commercial quotas, prohibitions on target fishing many species, recreational bag limits, limits on set-net length, mesh size and soak time, and closure of many inshore waters to set-netting, trawling and Danish seining},

Between 1988mdash;89 and 1997mdash;98,about 450 000 blue sharks (\textit{Prionace glauca}), 65 000 porbeagles (\textit{Lamna nasus} ) and 25 000 shortfin makos (\textit{Isurus oxyrinchus}) were caught. In 1997mdash;98,about 45 000 blue sharks, 4000 porbeagles and 3000 makos were caught. Corresponding weight estimates were 1400 t, 150 t and 200 t. CPUE varied between foreign and domestic vessels, between north and south regions and among years, but there were no consistent temporal trends. Most males and females were immature, and most sharks were alive when recovered. Most sharks were processed, but usually only the fins were retained. The New Zealand tuna longline fishery is probably not seriously affecting pelagic shark stocks, but adequate assessment is not currently feasible. Accurate monitoring of Pacific Ocean catches is an important first step towards ensuring sustainability of their populations.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {A demographic technique is used to compare the intrinsic rates of population increase of 26 shark species hypothetically exposed to fishing mortality. These rates (r2M) are used as a measure of the relative ability of different sharks to recover from fishing pressure. The method incorporates concepts of density dependence from standard population modelling and uses female age at maturity, maximum reproductive age, and average fecundity. A compensatory response to population reduction is assumed in pre-adult survival to the extent possible given the constraints of the life-history parameters. ‘Rebound’ productivity was strongly affected by age at maturity and little affected by maximum age. Species with lowest values (r2M {\textless} 0.04) tended to be late-maturing medium- to large-sized coastal sharks, whereas those with the highest ({\textgreater} 0.08) were small coastal, early-maturing species. Sharks with mid-range values (r2M = 0.04–0.07) were mostly large ({\textgreater} 250 cm maximum size) pelagic species, relatively fast growing and early maturing. Possible selection pressures for these three shark groups, management implications, practical applications for the derived parameter r2M, and recommended areas of research are discussed.},

	abstract = {Delayed effects of fisheries capture on the physiology and condition of sharks are poorly understood, but information on the post-release fate of sharks that have been incidentally captured, handled, and released is important to elaborate effective fisheries management measures for by-catch shark species. By-catch is often substantial during commercial trawling operations, and fish are exposed to a multitude of different stressful stimuli during trawl capture. We subjected Port Jackson sharks, Heterodontus portusjacksoni, and gummy sharks, Mustelus antarcticus, to trawl capture in a controlled setting to investigate effects of tow duration, exposure to air, and crowding in the codend, and monitored their condition via repeated blood sampling during a 72-h recovery period subsequent to the capture event. Port Jackson sharks experienced a low degree of physiological disturbance in response to our capture treatments and no mortality was observed during or after any experiments. Conversely, homeostatic balance of gummy sharks was severely disrupted by trawl capture, and immediate and delayed mortality was substantial (up to 87\%) during some experiments. Moribund gummy sharks showed significantly increased blood lactate ({\textgreater}15�mmol/L) and potassium levels ({\textgreater}8�mmol/L) compared with surviving sharks, but these differences did not become evident until 6-12�h after the capture event. There was no strong evidence for an increase in physiological disturbance with increasing tow duration in either species. Extended periods of air exposure ({\textgreater}10�min) following a capture event may lead to additional physiological stress, but simulated crowding as performed in the present study did not result in increased physiological stress compared with trawl capture of individual animals. The results of this study suggest that trawl capture may lead to significant immediate and delayed mortality in gummy sharks, and that extended air exposure on deck may further exacerbate the deleterious effects of capture stress},

	abstract = {Trophic studies are fundamental components of our understanding of biology and ecology, from observing individual organisms to modelling ecosystem function. When measuring fish gut contents, we rely on collecting samples that represent snapshots in time. Many limitations in extrapolating from these snapshots are well understood. However, there seems to be a widespread belief that when quantifying the composition of gut contents, more detail always provides more information. We highlight some fundamental problems with the apparently more quantitative approaches (i.e. ‘bulk’ methods measuring biomass or volume of each prey type) and suggest that frequency of occurrence (\%F) provides the most robust and interpretable measure of diet composition. The additional information provided by bulk methods contains unquantifiable and potentially significant error from a variety of sources. In our experience, the contents of most guts cannot be unambiguously separated into prey categories for quantification because of the presence of unidentifiable and inseparable partially digested material. Even where separation is possible, the composition of a gut at one point in time is affected by many unquantifiable factors unrelated to the actual composition of the diet. Consequently, bulk methods provide ambiguous interpretations from superficially quantitative models. Where research questions require more detail, these problems mean there is little alternative to time-consuming approaches like prey reconstruction. However, for the descriptions of dietary composition presented in many studies, \%F provides robust data that overcome many of the limitations of the more detailed approaches and provides considerable logistical and economic benefits.},

First, we used nonlinear least squares (NLS) to identify the growth model that best fitted the data. We then used this model, prior information and the data within a Bayesian framework to approximate the posterior distribution of the growth parameters. For all species the two-parameter von Bertalanffy growth model provided the best fit to size-at-age datasets. Based on this model, the Bayesian approach allowed the estimation of median values of WD∞ (cm) and k (yr-1) for the four species (H. uarnak: 149 and 0.12; N. kuhlii: 42 and 0.38; P. atrus 156 and 0.16, and T. lymma 33 and 0.24, respectively).

The estimates of mtDNA haplotype and nucleotide diversity were very similar in New Zealand (h= 0.735 ± 0.032, π= 0.001 ± 0.001) and Australia (h= 0.729 ± 0.027, π= 0.001 ± 0.001), but in Chile they were higher (h= 0.800 ± 0.089, π= 0.002 ± 0.001). The haplotype genealogy showed evidence of two distinct clades, New Zealand and Australia combined (clade 1), and Chile (clade 2). A power analysis suggested that sample sizes were large enough to detect any significant differences within clade 1. Neutrality test, mismatch distribution, and demographic reconstructions based on a coalescence approach, suggested that the Oceania population (clade 1) went through a period of population expansion, whereas the population size of the Chile population (clade 2) has been relatively stable over the last 20,000 years. Data from microsatellite loci also supported the separation of the Oceania and Chile populations. Principal component analysis suggested that there might also be a separation of groups within clade 1, which was not statistically significant (P= 0.434). The genetic data reported in this study supported the model of a single G. galeus stock in New Zealand and Australia. Our findings were consistent with previous tagging data that showed individual G. galeus migrate across the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand, and at least some of these migration events result in successful reproduction.},

	abstract = {Our understanding of the ecology of sharks and other highly mobile marine species often relies on fishery-dependent data or extractive fishery-independent techniques that can result in catchability and size-selectivity biases. Pelagic Baited Remote Underwater stereo-Video Systems (pelagic stereo-BRUVs) provide a standardized, non-destructive and fishery-independent approach to estimate biodiversity measures of fish assemblages in the water column. However, the performance of this novel method has not yet been assessed relative to other standard sampling techniques. We compared the catch composition, relative abundance and length distribution of fish assemblages sampled using pelagic stereo-BRUVs and conventional scientific longline surveys. In particular, we focused on sharks of the family Carcharhinidae (requiem sharks) to assess the sampling effectiveness of this novel technique along a latitudinal gradient off the coast of Western Australia. We calibrated the sampling effort required for each technique to obtain equivalent samples of the target species and discuss the advantages, limitations and potential use of these methods to study highly mobile species. The proportion of sharks sampled by pelagic stereo-BRUVs and scientific longline surveys was comparable across the latitudinal gradient. Carcharhinus plumbeus was the most abundant species sampled by both the techniques. Longline surveys selected larger individuals of the family Carcharhinidae in comparison with the length distribution data obtained from pelagic stereo-BRUVs. However, the relative abundance estimates (catch per unit of effort) from the pelagic stereo-BRUVs were comparable to those from 5 to 30 longline hooks. Pelagic stereo-BRUVs can be calibrated to standard techniques in order to study the species composition, behaviour, relative abundance and size distribution of highly mobile fish assemblages at broad spatial and temporal scales. This technique offers a non-destructive fishery-independent approach that can be implemented in areas that may be closed to fishing and is suitable for studies on rare or threatened species. © 2014 British Ecological Society.},

	abstract = {Genetic stock structure information is needed to delineate management units and monitor trade in sharks, many of which are heavily exploited and declining. The dusky shark Carcha -rhinus obscurus is a large apex predator that is sought after for its fins and is considered highly susceptible to overexploitation. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classifies this species as 'Vulnerable' globally and 'Endangered' in the northwest Atlantic. We make the first assessment of global stock structure of C. obscurus by analyzing part of the mitochondrial control region (mtCR) in 255 individuals sampled from 8 geographically dispersed locations. We found 25 mtCR haplotypes and rejected a null hypothesis of panmixia (analysis of molecular variance, ΦST = 0.55, p {\textless} 0.000001), detecting significant differentiation between 3 management units: US Atlantic (USATL), South Africa (SAF), and Australia (AUS). We also found preliminary evidence of population structure between the USATL and southwest Atlantic (Brazil). There were no shared haplotypes between the western Atlantic and Indo-Pacific. These analyses suggest that replenishment of the collapsed USATL management unit via immigration of females from elsewhere is unlikely. Mixed stock analysis (MSA) simulations show that reconstruction of the relative contributions of USATL, SAF, and AUS management units to the Asian fin trade is possible using these mtCR sequences. We suggest avenues for obtaining samples to conduct MSA of the shark fin trade, which could enhance management of dusky sharks and other species that are exploited for their fins. © Inter-Research 2011.},

	abstract = {As part of the global marine fisheries catch reconstruction project conducted by the Sea Around Us over the last decade, estimates were derived for discards in all major fisheries in the world. The reconstruction process derives conservative but non-zero time-series estimates for every fisheries component known to exist, and relies on a wide variety of data and information sources and on conservative assumptions to ensure comprehensive and complete time-series coverage. Globally, estimated discards increased from under 5 million t/year (t = 1,000 kg) in the early 1950s to a peak of 18.8 million t in 1989, and gradually declined thereafter to levels of the late 1950s of less than 10 million t/year. Thus, estimated discards represented between 10\% and 20\% of total reconstructed catches (reported landings + unreported landings + unreported discards) per year up to the year 2000, after which estimated discards accounted for slightly less than 10\% of total annual catches. Most discards were generated by industrial (i.e. large-scale) fisheries. Discarding occurred predominantly in northern Atlantic waters in the earlier decades (1950s–1980s), after which discarding off the West Coast of Africa dominated. More recently, fleets operating in Northwest Pacific and Western Central Pacific waters generated the most discards. In most areas, discards consist essentially of marketable taxa, suggesting a combination of poor fishing practices and poor management procedures is largely responsible for the waste discarding represents. This is important in an era of increasing food security and human nutritional health concerns, especially in developing countries.},

We also examined the regulatory measures currently applied to shark fisheries in Mexico to assess their efficacy in mitigating the impact on fishing mortality. Twenty-eight species had low productivity; only Mustelus californicus was placed in the moderate productivity category. Seventeen species had high susceptibility while 12 were placed in the moderate category. Twenty species were placed in the high vulnerability category, and nine in the moderate category. The five most vulnerable species were Sphyrna zygaena, Squatina californica, Heterodontus francisci, Isurus oxyrinchus, and Carcharhinus falciformis. The management-risk is high for all species; artisanal fisheries have a significant impact particularly on coastal shark species, which can be very sensitive to overfishing as well as large species that use the coastal area during the early stages of their development. Research priorities should include studies assessing the elasticity and demographic aspects of S. zygaena and I. oxyrinchus. Squatina californica and T. semifasciata require urgent at-tention due to the risk of extirpation. New regulations and improvements to existing legislation in Mexico may have a positive impact in shark populations, which can be examined in future assessments.},

The gillnets and longlines were much more effective at catching chondrichthyans than teleosts, and catches of species of cephalopoda, bivalvia, gastropoda, mammalia, aves and reptilia were negligible. Any reduction in the present legal minimum mesh-size of 6 inch the shark fishery would markedly increase by-catch. In gillnets monitored by scientific observers aboard commercial vessels during 1998-01, the ratio of the number of chondrichthyan to teleost animals was similar to 24:1 in Bass Strait and similar to 5:1 in South Australia. In Bass Strait between 1973-76 and 1998-2001, the catch rate by 6 inch mesh gillnets of chondrichthyans declined by one-third, whereas a change in the catch rate of teleosts was not statistically detectable. Most of this decline is explained by reductions of 54\% by Cephaloscyllium laticeps and of 87\% by Galeorhinus galeus. The retained commercial catch was 74\% of the chondrichthyan animals and 58\% of the teleosts caught; only 3\% of the chondrichthyans and 2\% of the teleosts were discarded dead.

Following a recent spate of fatal white shark attacks, the Government of Western Australia introduced a range of initiatives to mitigate shark hazards. An increasing trend in shark attacks over the last 20 years has been commonly perceived to be the result of an increase in population abundance since the species’ protection in Australian waters in 1997. We modelled potential population productivity and trajectories using different scenarios of life-history strategies, unexploited population sizes, reconstructed fishery catches and post-capture mortality. Under zero fishing mortality, the potential annual increase in population abundance varied from 2 to 6\% per year, depending upon the assumed life history strategy. Depending upon model inputs there was a wide range of potential declines in abundance since 1938/39 and significant differences in the potential population trajectories since protection. However, no scenario (n = 120) resulted in a total population increase of {\textgreater} 31\% since protection, with most scenarios showing population increase of 10\% or less. We present a method for exploring the effects of alternative hypotheses about key population parameters when data are scarce and when scientific advice is required for guiding decision making and informing public debate.},

A total of 689 animals across 22 species and including 18 elasmobranchs were landed. For the five species (Carcharhinus spp.), and one genus (Sphyrna spp) where there were sufficient numbers for analysis, generalised linear mixed models showed that species and the elapsed time spent on the line after hooking were the strongest predictors of at-vessel mortality, with spinner (Carcharhinus brevipinna), blacktip (C. limbatus) and hammerhead (Sphyrna spp) sharks exhibiting the highest death rates. The variables which best explained mortality, included: (i) sex of the caught sharks, and the interaction between species with (ii) capture depth, and (iii) the elapsed time spent on the line after hooking. For the subset of dusky (C. obscurus) and sandbar (C. plumbeus) sharks examined for physiological status at the point of capture, very few of the 13 chosen blood analytes varied significantly. Given the observed high mortality rates and stress associated with the time spent on the line after capture, operational changes to reduce these adverse impacts should be considered. Even simple changes such as shorter soak times could considerably mitigate these impacts.},

Here we use large-scale genotyping to look for parent–offspring pairs among 14,000 tissue samples of juvenile and adult tuna collected from the fisheries, finding 45 pairs in total. Using a modified mark-recapture framework where ‘recaptures’ are kin rather than individuals, we can estimate adult abundance and other demographic parameters such as survival, without needing to use contentious fishery catch or effort data. Our abundance estimates are substantially higher and more precise than previously thought, indicating a somewhat less-depleted and more productive stock. More broadly, this technique of ‘close-kin mark-recapture’ has widespread utility in fisheries and wildlife conservation. It estimates a key parameter for management— the absolute abundance of adults—while avoiding the expense of independent surveys or tag-release programmes, and the interpretational problems of fishery catch rates. 1},

Quantifying the post-capture survival (PCS) of discarded species is therefore essential for the improved management and conservation of this group. For all chondrichthyans taken in the main shark fishery of Australia, we quantified the immediate PCS of individuals reaching the deck of commercial shark gillnet fishing vessels and applied a risk-based method to semi-quantitatively determine delayed and total PCS. Estimates of immediate, delayed and total PCS were consistent, being very high for the most commonly discarded species (Port Jackson shark, Australian swellshark, and spikey dogfish) and low for the most important commercial species (gummy and school sharks). Increasing gillnet soak time or water temperature significantly decreased PCS. Chondrichthyans with bottom-dwelling habits had the highest PCS whereas those with pelagic habits had the lowest PCS. The risk-based approach can be easily implemented as a standard practice of on-board observing programs, providing a convenient first-step assessment of the PCS of all species taken in commercial fisheries.},

	abstract = {Alerstam, T., Hedenström, A. and A , kesson, S. 2003. Long-distance migration: evolution and determinants. – Oikos 103: 247– 260. Long-distance migration has evolved in many organisms moving through different media and using various modes of locomotion and transport. Migration continues to evolve or become suppressed as shown by ongoing dynamic and rapid changes of migration patterns. This great evolutionary flexibility may seem surprising for such a complex attribute as migration. Even if migration in most cases has evolved basically as a strategy to maximise fitness in a seasonal environment, its occurrence and extent depend on a multitude of factors. We give a brief overview of different factors (e.g. physical, geographical, historical, ecological) likely to facilitate and/or constrain the evolution of long-distance migration and discuss how they are likely to affect migration. The basic driving forces for migration are ecological and biogeographic factors like seasonality, spatiotemporal distributions of resources, habitats, predation and competition. The benefit of increased resource availability will be balanced by costs associated with the migratory process in terms of time (incl. losses of prior occupancy advantages), energy and mortality (incl. increased exposure to parasites). Furthermore, migration requires genetic instructions (allowing substantial room for learning in some of the traits) about timing, duration and distance of migration as well as about behavioural and physiological adaptations (fuelling, organ flexibility, locomotion, use of environmental transport etc) and control of orientation and navigation. To what degree these costs and requirements put constraints on migra-tion often depends on body size according to different scaling relationships. From this exposé it is clear that research on migration warrants a multitude of techniques and approaches for a complete as possible understanding of a very complex evolu-tionary syndrome. In addition, we also present examples of migratory distances in a variety of taxons. In recent years new techniques, especially satellite radio telemetry, provide new information of unprecedented accuracy about journeys of individual animals, allowing re-evaluation of migration, locomotion and navigation theories.},

Two bycatch ratios were considered: the number and the weight of elasmobranch bycatch relative to that of the target species captured. Patterns were determined through machine learning algorithms with gear type, oceanic region, habitat and the presence or absence of bycatch management measures as candidate predictors. There are considerable information gaps. Most of the current information on elasmobranch bycatch is for the North Atlantic, which is not where the greatest fishing pressure is exerted, so several fisheries were largely under-represented. Overall for sharks, gear type was the most important predictor with pelagic longline fisheries in the South Atlantic displaying the highest bycatch ratios. No patterns were found for ray bycatch ratios. For the fisheries considered in this study, pelagic longlines, and deep-sea and coastal trawl fisheries had the largest total annual shark and ray bycatch, respectively. Blue sharks (Prionace glauca, Carcharhinidae) dominated the total annual bycatch of longline fisheries. For other fishing gears, the annual species-specific bycatch composition varied across oceanic regions. Many of the fisheries with the largest elasmobranch bycatch operate over large spatial scales and often in international waters. International management, mitigation and cooperation are an essential component for the sustainability of elasmobranch bycatch species. Data collection systems and data availability are required at a global scale to improve assessments of elasmobranch bycatch and this should be a high priority for ongoing management and monitoring. •The gear type of a particular fishery was the most important predictor variable for shark bycatch ratios.•Pelagic longline fisheries had the highest shark bycatch ratios.•Deep-sea trawl and pelagic longline fisheries caught the largest quantity of rays and sharks, respectively.•Substantial information gaps exist in elasmobranch bycatch data complicating global analyses.},

For C. obscurus, weak genetic differentiation was detected be tween eastern and western Australian waters (pairwise ΦST = 0.04437, p \&lt; 0.008; pairwise FST = 0.02403, p \&lt; 0.035), suggesting the delineation of 2 independent populations, while patterns of gene flow be tween Australia and Indonesia were inconclusive. Rarefaction analysis, however, indicated that robust population comparisons in these species were reliant on sample numbers \&gt;100 at any particular location. OffAustralia's temperate east coast, C. obscurus and C. plumbeus exhibited strong similarities in genetic structure, suggestive of similar evolutionary histories in the region. In addition, genetic validation revealed observers to be highly accurate in the identification of both target species in an eastern Australian shark fishery.

	abstract = {Since the mid 1990's, stock assessments of shark populations in the northwest Atlantic by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) have indicated that sandbar (. Carcharhinus plumbeus) and dusky (. C. obscurus) populations are overfished. In response to these assessments, the dusky shark bottom longline fishery was closed in 2000, followed by the sandbar fishery in 2005. A common management strategy is to mandate the release of prohibited species if caught as bycatch. However, a major assumption is that most released sharks survive, which may not be the case. Longline operations were conducted during 2011 and 2012 to capture and tag sandbar and dusky sharks, in order to assess (1) at-vessel mortality, (2) post-release mortality, and (3) investigate the effects of soak-time on each of these variables for each species. Our findings show that dusky sharks experience high at-vessel and post-release mortality, with mortality occurring more frequently after 3-5. h on the line. While time-on-the-line (TOL) increased dusky shark at-vessel (16\% when less than 3 h TOL; 27.5\% when more than 3 h TOL) and post-release mortality (11\% when less than 3 h TOL; 42\% when more than 3 h TOL), sandbar shark at-vessel mortality was low (0\% when less than 3 h TOL). Nonetheless, the apparently hardier sandbar sharks did exhibit 29\% post-release mortality after 3 h TOL. The total mortality (at-vessel. +. post-release, including moribund individuals) for dusky sharks was 97\% after being captured on a demersal longline when TOL surpassed 3. h. These data clearly elucidate an interspecific difference in vulnerability to longline gear between these species.},

However, little is known about their movement and the possible fate of discards. We redressed this lack of knowledge using pop-up satellite archival tags (PSAT) and acoustic tagging technologies off the eastern coast of Australia. Eight sharks of each species were caught by demersal longline, fitted with both types of tag and then released. PSATs indicated that 2 C. plumbeus and 1 C. obscurus died within 8 h of release, while tracks over periods of 1 to 60 d were obtained for 13 sharks. All surviving sharks first swam in an easterly, offshore direction to outer-shelf waters during the first 24 h. All C. plumbeus then moved approximately south (i.e. increasing latitude) by distances of up to  ̃350 km. In contrast, most C. obscurus moved approximately north by distances between 212 and 606 km. Over an 18 mo period following release, acoustic tag detections occurred for 4 C. plumbeus (mostly within 30 km of release, suggesting some philopatry) and 6 C. obscurus ( ̃515 km south and  ̃310 km north). Both species spent  ̃85\% of their time in waters {\textless}100 m deep. Diel patterns in vertical movements of C. plumbeus were detected, with a preference for deeper water during daylight hours. Both species mainly utilised water temperatures between 22 and 26°C. Information from this study can be used for the effective management of commercially exploited stocks of both species.},

A pre-recruit survival model for the early life history of elasmobranchs was developed and parameterized using biological data. Then, an existing age-structured model for the reproductive ecology of teleost fishes was modified for elasmobranchs and combined with the pre-recruit model. The combined model was then applied to the North Pacific blue shark (Prionace glauca). The stock-recruitment relationships of this species were clarified using the biological data collected from wide areas of the western North Pacific. The model provides a point estimate for steepness, which represents a fraction of the unfished recruitment when spawning stock biomass is 20\% of the unfished spawning stock biomass. Numerical simulations were conducted to incorporate uncertainties in the biological parameters and produce the variance of steepness. The mean value and its standard deviation for steepness with the Beverton-Holt model were 0.584 (standard deviation = 0.099). The results suggest that the stock-recruitment relationship in North Pacific blue shark remains highly density-dependent and that its productivity is higher than that of other viviparous elasmobranchs.},

Modern fisheries monitoring techniques, including vessel monitoring systems (VMS), have advanced this endeavor. This paper presents a framework for using VMS data to develop spatial distributions of catch, fishing effort, and catch per unit of effort (CPUE) as well as associated estimates of uncertainty in a vertical line fishery.

	abstract = {Due to rapid declines of shark populations across many species and regions of the world, the need for large-scale conservation measures has become widely recognized. Some coastal states have opted to implement ‘Shark Sanctuaries’, which prohibit commercial shark fishing and the export of shark products across large areas, typically their entire Exclusive Economic Zones. Although shark sanctuaries cover almost as much area globally as marine protected areas (MPAs), their success has yet to be evaluated. Here, key features and regulatory details for eleven shark sanctuaries (covering 3\% of global ocean area) are summarized, highlighting their commonalities and differences. Catch data are then used to shed light on the impact current shark sanctuaries could have on shark catch, foreign fleets, trade and abundance. Based on this comparative analysis, recommendations are made to implement program evaluation measures within existing and future shark sanctuaries that would explicitly outline goals and measures of success or failure. In summary, although shark sanctuaries may have the intended effect of reducing shark mortality, there appears a need to address bycatch within shark sanctuary regulations, and to collect baseline data that can be used to monitor sanctuary effectiveness.},

The approach is based on typologies of fishing operations involving multivariate descriptive methods like factorial analyses and classification techniques. The obtained types of fishing operations are considered as fishing tactics. The approach is applied to two contrasting examples, a small-scale Senegalese fishery and a Celtic Sea fishery that operates at a larger scale.

In response, we developed a spatial dynamic factor analysis (SDFA) model that decomposes covariation in multispecies catch rates into components representing spatial variation and fishing behavior. SDFA estimates spatiotemporal variation in fish density for multiple species and accounts for fisher behavior at large spatial scales (i.e., choice of fishing location) while controlling for fisher behavior at fine spatial scales (e.g., daily timing of fishing activity). We first use a multispecies simulation experiment to show that SDFA decreases bias in abundance indices relative to ignoring spatial adjustments and fishing tactics.Wethen present results for a case study involving petrale sole (Eopsetta jordani) in the California Current, for which SDFA estimates initially stable and then increasing abundance for the period 1986–2003, in accordance with fishery-independent survey and stock assessment estimates.},

Questions covered society member opinions on conservation and management policies, personal histories of involvement in advocacy and management, and perceptions of the approach of conservation nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to shark conservation. One hundred and two surveys were completed (overall response rate 21\%). Respondents considered themselves knowledgeable about and actively involved in conservation and management policy; a majority believed scientists have a responsibility to advocate for conservation (75\%), and majorities have sent formal public comments to policymakers (54\%) and included policy suggestions in their papers (53\%). They believe sustainable shark fisheries are possible, are currently happening today (in a few places), and should be the goal instead of banning fisheries. Respondents were generally less supportive of newer limit-based (i.e., policies that ban exploitation entirely without a species- specific focus) conservation policy tools, such as shark sanctuaries and bans on the sale of shark fins, than of target-based fisheries management tools (i.e., policies that allow for sustainable harvest of species whose populations canwithstand it), such as fishing quotas. Respondents were generally supportive of environmental NGO efforts to conserve sharks but raised concerns about some NGOs that they perceived as using incorrect information and focusing on the wrong problems. Our results show there is an ongoing debate in shark conservation and management circles relative to environmental policy on target-based natural resources management tools versus limit-based conservation tools. They also suggest that closer communication between the scientific and environmental NGO communitiesmay be needed to recognize and reconcile differing values and objectives between these groups.},

Although these localized surveys annually sample the same populations, resulting trends in yearly indices often conflict with one another, thereby hindering interpretation of abundance patterns at broad spatial scales. We used delta-lognormal generalized linear models (GLMs) to generate indices of abundance for seven Atlantic coastal shark species from six fishery-independent surveys along the US east coast and Gulf of Mexico from 1975 to 2014. These indices were further analysed using dynamic factor analysis (DFA) to produce simplified, broad-scale common trends in relative abundance over the entire sampled distribution. Effects of drivers including the North Atlantic Oscillation index, the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation index, annually averaged sea surface temperature and species landings were evaluated within the DFA model. The two decadal oscillations and species landings were shown to affect shark distribution along south-east US coast. Estimated common trends of relative abundance for all large coastal shark species showed similar decreasing patterns into the early 1990s, periods of sustained low index values thereafter and recent indications of recovery. Small coastal shark species exhibited more regional variability in their estimated common trends, such that two common trends were required to adequately describe patterns in relative abundance throughout the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic. Overall, all species' (except the Gulf of Mexico blacknose shark) time series concluded with an increasing trend, suggestive of initial recovery from past exploitation.},

	abstract = {The maximum intrinsic rate of population increase (r max) is a commonly estimated demographic parameter used in assessments of extinction risk. In teleosts, r max can be calculated using an estimate of spawners per spawner, but for chondrich-thyans, most studies have used annual reproductive output (b) instead. This is problematic as it effectively assumes all juveniles survive to maturity. Here, we propose an updated r max equation that uses a simple mortality estimator that also accounts for survival to maturity: the reciprocal of average life-span. For 94 chondrichthyans, we now estimate that r max values are on average 10\% lower than previously published. Our updated r max estimates are lower than previously published for species that mature later relative to maximum age and those with high annual fecundity. The most extreme discrepancies in r max values occur in species with low age at maturity and low annual reproductive output. Our results indicate that chondrichthyans that mature relatively later in life, and to a lesser extent those that are highly fecund, are less resilient to fishing than previously thought. Résumé : Le taux intrinsèque maximum d'accroissement de la population (r max) est un paramètre démographique couramment estimé, utilisé dans les évaluations du risque de disparition. Pour les téléostéens, r max peut être calculé en utilisant le nombre estimé de géniteurs par géniteur, mais pour les chondrichthyens, la plupart des études ont plutôt utilisé l'efficacité de la reproduction annuelle (b). Cette approche pose problème parce qu'elle présuppose que tous les juvéniles survivent jusqu'à la maturité. Nous proposons une équation révisée pour r max qui utilise un estimateur de la mortalité simple qui tient également compte de la survie jusqu'à la maturité, soit la réciproque de la longévité moyenne. Pour 94 chondrichthyens, nous estimons que les nouvelles valeurs de r max sont en moyenne 10 \% plus faibles que les valeurs déjà publiées. Nous estimations révisées de r max sont plus faibles que les valeurs déjà publiées pour les espèces qui atteignent la maturité plus tard par rapport à l'âge maximum et les espèces à forte fécondité annuelle. Les écarts les plus grands des valeurs de r max sont observés pour les espèces qui atteignent la maturité en bas âge et dont l'efficacité de la reproduction annuelle est faible. Nos résultats indiquent que les chondrichthyens qui atteignent la maturité plus tard et, dans une moindre mesure, qui sont très féconds, ont une moins grande résilience à la pêche que ce qui était présumé auparavant.

Recent studies show that the approach may precisely identify spatial hotspots in species distribution, but have not addressed whether seasonal hotspots are identifiable using commonly available fishery data. In this study, we analyzed the seasonal spatio-temporal distribution of pelagic sharks in the western and central North Pacific using fishery catch rates and a generalized linear mixed model with spatio-temporal effects. Different spatial distribution patterns were observed between two shark species. The hotspots of shortfin mako (SFM) appeared in the vicinity of the coastal and offshore waters of Japan and the Kuroshio-Oyashio transition zone (TZ), whereas the hotspots of blue shark (BSH) were widely distributed in the areas from the TZ to the waters of the Emperor Seamount Chain. Shortfin mako distribution changes seasonally with clear north-south movement, which follows higher sea surface temperatures (SST). However, preferred spring and summer water temperature was still colder than those in fall and winter, but not as cold as for BSH, which did not show seasonal north-south movement. BSH exhibits seasonal east-west movement apparently unrelated to temperature. The spatial fishing effort by season generally follows the seasonal movement of temperature possibly making SFM more vulnerable to the fishery than BSH. These findings could be used to reduce the capture risk of bycatch sharks and to better manage the spatial distribution of fishing for targeted sharks.},

By contrast, no significant genetic differences were observed between locations from within the Pacific or Indian Oceans, identifying an apparent large, single Indo-Pacific population. A lack of differentiation between tiger sharks sampled in Hawaii and other Indo-Pacific locations identified herein is in contrast to an earlier global tiger shark nDNA study. The results of our power analysis provide evidence to suggest that the larger sample sizes used here negated any weak population subdivision observed previously.

	abstract = {© 2017 The Author(s). Predators play a crucial role in the structure and function of ecosystems. However, the magnitude of this role is often unclear, particularly for large marine predators, as predation rates are difficult to measure directly. If relevant biotic and abiotic parameters can be obtained, then bioenergetics modelling offers an alternative approach to estimating predation rates, and can provide new insights into ecological processes. We integrate demographic and ecological data for a marine apex predator, the broadnose sevengill shark Notorynchus cepedianus, with energetics data from the literature, to construct a bioenergetics model to quantify predation rates on key fisheries species in Norfolk Bay, Australia. We account for the uncertainty in model parameters by incorporating parameter confidence through Monte Carlo simulations and running alternative variants of the model. Model and parameter variants provide alternative estimates of predation rates. Our simplest model estimates that ca. 1130 ± 137 N. cepedianus individuals consume 11,379 (95\% CI: 11,111-11,648) gummy sharks Mustelus antarcticus ( ̃21 tonnes) over a 36-week period in Norfolk Bay, which represents a considerable contribution to total predation mortality on this key fishery species. This study demonstrates how the integration of ecology and fisheries science can provide information for ecosystem and fisheries management.},

Excellent for data-poor spatial management but hard to use Marine resource managers and scientists often advocate spatial approaches to manage data-poor species. Existing spatial prediction and management techniques are either insuffi-ciently robust, struggle with sparse input data, or make suboptimal use of multiple explana-tory variables. Boosted Regression Trees feature excellent performance and are well suited to modelling the distribution of data-limited species, but are extremely complicated and time-consuming to learn and use, hindering access for a wide potential user base and there-fore limiting uptake and usage. BRTs automated and simplified for accessible general use with rich feature set We have built a software suite in R which integrates pre-existing functions with new tailor-made functions to automate the processing and predictive mapping of species abundance data: by automating and greatly simplifying Boosted Regression Tree spatial modelling, the gbm.auto R package suite makes this powerful statistical modelling technique more acces-sible to potential users in the ecological and modelling communities. The package and its documentation allow the user to generate maps of predicted abundance, visualise the repre-sentativeness of those abundance maps and to plot the relative influence of explanatory var-iables and their relationship to the response variables. Databases of the processed model objects and a report explaining all the steps taken within the model are also generated. The package includes a previously unavailable Decision Support Tool which combines esti-mated escapement biomass (the percentage of an exploited population which must be retained each year to conserve it) with the predicted abundance maps to generate maps showing the location and size of habitat that should be protected to conserve the target stocks (candidate MPAs), based on stakeholder priorities, such as the minimisation of fish-ing effort displacement.

Boosted Regression Tree models are used to predict abundance of juvenile and mature female cuckoo (Leucoraja naevus), thornback (Raja clavata), blonde (Raja brachyura), and spotted (Raja montagui) rays in the Irish Sea using fish survey data and data describing fishing pressure, predation and environmental variables. Model-predicted spatial abundance maps of these subsets reveal distinct nuances in species distributions with greater predictive power than maps of the whole stock.

	doi = {10.1016/j.marpol.2017.10.028},
	abstract = {Assessing the stock status of mixed and/or multi-species fishery resources is challenging. This is especially true in highly diverse systems, where landed catches are small, but comprise many species. In these circumstances, whole-of-ecosystem management requires consideration of the impact of harvesting on a plethora of species. However, this is logistically infeasible and cost prohibitive. To overcome this issue, selected ‘indicator’ species are used to assess the risk to sustainability of all ‘like’ species susceptible to capture within a fishery resource. Indicator species are determined via information on their (1) inherent vulnerability, i.e. biological attributes; (2) risk to sustainability, i.e. stock status; and (3) management importance, i.e. commercial prominence, social and/or cultural amenity value of the resource. These attributes are used to determine an overall score for each species which is used to identify ‘indicator’ species. The risk status (i.e. current risk) of the indicator species then determines the risk-level for the biological sustainability of the entire fishery resource and thus the level of priority for management, monitoring, assessment and compliance. A range of fishery management regimes are amenable to the indicator species approach, including both effort limited fisheries (e.g. individually transferable effort systems) and output controlled fisheries (e.g. species-specific catch quotas). The indicator species approach has been used and refined for fisheries resources in Western Australia over two decades. This process is now widely understood and accepted by stakeholders, as it focuses fishery dependent- and/or independent-monitoring, biological sampling, stock assessment and compliance priorities, thereby optimising the use of available jurisdictional resources.},

	abstract = {1. Ecologists use statistical models for both explanation and prediction, and need techniques that are flexible enough to express typical features of their data, such as nonlinearities and interactions. 2. This study provides a working guide to boosted regression trees (BRT), an ensemble method for fitting statistical models that differs fundamentally from conventional techniques that aim to fit a single parsimonious model. Boosted regression trees combine the strengths of two algorithms: regression trees (models that relate a response to their predictors by recursive binary splits) and boosting (an adaptive method for combining many simple models to give improved predictive performance). The final BRT model can be understood as an additive regression model in which individual terms are simple trees, fitted in a forward, stagewise fashion. 3. Boosted regression trees incorporate important advantages of tree-based methods, handling different types of predictor variables and accommodating missing data. They have no need for prior data transformation or elimination of outliers, can fit complex nonlinear relationships, and automatically handle interaction effects between predictors. Fitting multiple trees in BRT overcomes the biggest drawback of single tree models: their relatively poor predictive performance. Although BRT models are complex, they can be summarized in ways that give powerful ecological insight, and their predictive performance is superior to most traditional modelling methods. 4. The unique features of BRT raise a number of practical issues in model fitting. We demonstrate the practicalities and advantages of using BRT through a distributional analysis of the short-finned eel (Anguilla australis Richardson), a native freshwater fish of New Zealand. We use a data set of over 13 000 sites to illustrate effects of several settings, and then fit and interpret a model using a subset of the data. We provide code and a tutorial to enable the wider use of BRT by ecologists.},

	abstract = {Conservation concerns exist for many sharks but robust estimates of abundance are often lacking. Improving population status is a performance measure for species under conservation or recovery plans, yet the lack of data permitting estimation of population size means the efficacy of management actions can be difficult to assess, and achieving the goal of removing species from conservation listing challenging. For potentially dangerous species, like the white shark, balancing conservation and public safety demands is politically and socially complex, often leading to vigorous debate about their population status. This increases the need for robust information to inform policy decisions. We developed a novel method for estimating the total abundance of white sharks in eastern Australia and New Zealand using the genetic-relatedness of juveniles and applying a close-kin mark-recapture framework and demographic model. Estimated numbers of adults are small (ca. 280–650), as is total population size (ca. 2,500–6,750). However, estimates of survival probability are high for adults (over 90\%), and fairly high for juveniles (around 73\%). This represents the first direct estimate of total white shark abundance and survival calculated from data across both the spatial and temporal life-history of the animal and provides a pathway to estimate population trend.},

These are compounded in multispecies fisheries, as it is not possible to achieve all individual targets simultaneously if targets are set on a species-by-species basis. Identifying appropriate targets both conceptually and empirically has also proven challenging, and consequently the implementation of economic targets to real world fisheries have been limited to a small number of data-rich and high-valued fisheries, with reliance on proxy target reference points in other fisheries. Moreover, these application has been limited due to unknowns as to what proxies should be used under different circumstances. Here, we review the alternative ways in which MEY has been estimated and applied in multispecies fisheries. We also review the roles and potential use of proxy target reference points for multispecies MEY in data-limited fisheries, building on Australian’s experience in implementing such a policy.},

This surprisingly high subtropical carbon uptake cannot be fully accounted for by sediment trap-collected sinking particles and the downward mixing of suspended and dissolved organic carbon. We propose an explanation for these paradoxical observations: gel-like organic matter rich in carbon but poor in nutrients, akin to transparent exopolymer particles, is produced by phytoplankton under nutrient limitation, and a portion sinks into the shallow subsurface, where it is respired by heterotrophic bacteria. This organic matter would evade detection by sediment traps, effectively representing an additional (sinking-driven) source of dissolved organic carbon to the subsurface. Building on existing evidence for the production of such nutrient-poor organic matter in surface waters, we describe evidence for its decomposition in the shallow subsurface of the Sargasso Sea. First, oxygen at these depths is consumed over the summer without comparable production of nitrate. Second, a seasonal change in the},

	abstract = {Fisheries management systems around the world are highly diverse in their design, operation, and effectiveness at meeting objectives. A variety of management institutions, strategies, and tactics are used across disparate regions, fishing fleets, and taxonomic groups. At a global level, it is unclear which particular management attributes have greatest influence on the status of fished populations, and also unclear which external factors affect the overall success of fisheries management systems. We used expert surveys to characterize the management systems by species of 28 major fishing nations and examined influences of economic, geographic, and fishery-related factors. A Fisheries Management Index, which integrated research, management, enforcement, and socioeconomic attributes, showed wide variation among countries and was strongly affected by per capita gross domestic product (positively) and capacity-enhancing subsidies (negatively). Among 13 management attributes consid-ered, three were particularly influential in whether stock size and fishing mortality are currently in or trending toward desirable states: extensiveness of stock assessments, strength of fishing pressure limits, and comprehensiveness of enforcement programs. These results support arguments that the key to successful fisheries management is the implementation and enforcement of science-based catch or effort limits, and that monetary investment into fisheries can help achieve management objectives if used to limit fishing pressure rather than enhance fishing capacity. Countries with currently less-effective management systems have the greatest potential for improving long-term stock status outcomes and should be the focus of efforts to improve fisheries management globally. resource management {\textbar} stock assessment {\textbar} fisheries enforcement {\textbar} fishery subsidies {\textbar} marine conservation S tudies in recent years have yielded divergent views of the status of marine populations and recommendations for how the world's fisheries should best be managed (1–6). Although scientists are generally unanimous in calling for stronger management, some proposed solutions involve widespread establishment of marine reserves (4), whereas others involve greater investment in man-agement structures, such as stock assessments and enforcement of catch or effort limits (6–8), or in reforms of fishing fleets toward rights-based management (1). Fisheries management systems in-volve a wide array of policies and regulations to meet conservation and socioeconomic objectives (5, 9, 10). These aspects vary within and among countries, target species, and fishing fleets. Given the great diversity in fisheries management systems, it has not been clear which specific management characteristics lead to success across systems, but it seems increasingly clear that successful at-tributes involve the capacity to limit fishing pressure (1, 2, 6–8, 11). We used expert surveys to characterize attributes of research, management, enforcement, and socioeconomics of fisheries man-agement systems in 28 major fishing countries that collectively ac-count for {\textgreater}80\% of global total catch. We specified survey criteria as to whether these attributes play an effective role in limiting fishing pressure for target species. We quantified geographic, economic, and fishery-related influences on the management system, and in turn quantified how management attributes individually affect re-cent status and trends of stock size and fishing mortality. Survey responses from fishery experts showed high variability among 28 countries in research, management, enforcement, and socioeconomics dimensions of management systems, as well as in stock status (Fig. 1). Values for each dimension are weighted means of several criteria, with answers of 0, 0.5, or 1 reflecting the degree to which a criterion was met for each of 10 species in the country. Survey responses were correlated among research, man-agement, enforcement, and socioeconomics dimensions (r = 0.66– 0.82) (Fig. S1A) and were averaged with equal weighting to obtain a Fisheries Management Index (FMI) for each returned survey (n = 191) (Fig. S2A), which were subsequently aggregated by country. FMI is an indicator of the effectiveness of management systems at meeting objectives. Survey responses were weighted by confidence scores in answers provided for individual questions and self-assigned level of expertise; sensitivity analyses considered alternative weighting schemes.

	abstract = {Tonic immobility is a widely used technique for the surgical implantation of acoustic tags in elasmobranchs (sharks, skates, and rays), yet it is still not broadly recognised as an acceptable procedure by many regulatory bodies, animal care committees, and even journal ethics standards. To highlight its regular use and applicability as a field procedure, a literature search was conducted on the anaesthetic technique adopted for all existing elasmobranch-focused acoustic telemetry papers, up to 31 December 2013. A total of 57 studies were identified that contained relevant details on surgical methodological procedures. Of these, the majority of studies (43, or 75.4\%) employed tonic immobility, while 10 (17.6\%) used general chemical anaesthetic and 4 (7\%) used local chemical anaesthetic. These studies identify that tonic immobility provides an effective anaesthetic for surgical implantation in elasmobranchs, as it offers several benefits over chemical anaesthetics, both from a practical and from an animal welfare perspective. Practically, rapid induction and recovery optimizes the surgical procedure, desirable under often complex field conditions, where general chemical anaesthetics prolong duration and administration is often unfeasible because of the size of study animals. Benefits over chemical anaesthetic for animal welfare include no risk of overdose, no uptake of chemicals to body tissues, minimal disruption to respiration, thereby reducing potential for negative sublethal impacts that influence postrelease behaviour, and immediate and full recovery. Given these benefits and its long-standing use in field studies, it is recommended that tonic immobility be recognised as an acceptable anaesthetic technique for surgical procedures on elasmobranchs.},

	abstract = {The sandbar shark, Carcharhinus plumbeus, is a large, cosmopolitan, coastal species. Females are thought to show philopatry to nursery grounds while males potentially migrate long distances, creating an opportunity for male-mediated gene flow that may lead to discordance in patterns revealed by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear markers. While this dynamic has been investigated in elasmobranchs over small spatial scales, it has not been examined at a global level. We examined patterns of historical phylogeography and contemporary gene flow by genotyping 329 individuals from nine locations throughout the species’ range at eight nuclear microsatellite markers and sequencing the complete mtDNA control region. Pairwise comparisons often resulted in fixation indices and divergence estimates of greater magnitude using mtDNA sequence data than microsatellite data. In addition, multiple methods of estimation suggested fewer populations based on microsatellite loci than on mtDNA sequence data. Coalescent analyses suggest divergence and restricted migration among Hawaii, Taiwan, eastern and western Australia using mtDNA sequence data and no divergence and high migration rates, between Taiwan and both Australian sites using microsatellite data. Evidence of secondary contact was detected between several localities and appears to be discreet in time rather than continuous. Collectively, these data suggest complex spatial/temporal relationships between shark populations that may feature pulses of female dispersal and more continuous male-mediated gene flow.},

	abstract = {Fishing and habitat degradation have increased the extinction risk of sharks, and conservation strategies recognize that survival of juveniles is critical for the effective management of shark populations. Despite the rapid expansion of marine protected areas (MPAs) globally, the paucity of shark-monitoring data on large scales (100s-1000s km) means that the effectiveness of MPAs in halting shark declines remains unclear. Using data collected by baited remote underwater video systems (BRUVS) in northwestern Australia, we developed generalized linear models to elucidate the ecological drivers of habitat suitability for juvenile sharks. We assessed occurrence patterns at the order and species levels. We included all juvenile sharks sampled and the 3 most abundant species sampled separately (grey reef [Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos], sandbar [Carcharhinus plumbeus], and whitetip reef sharks [Triaenodon obesus]). We predicted the occurrence of juvenile sharks across 490,515 km2 of coastal waters and quantified the representation of highly suitable habitats within MPAs. Our species-level models had higher accuracy (K(green) ≥ 0.69) and deviance explained (≥48\%) than our order-level model (K(green) = 0.36 and deviance explained of 10\%). Maps of predicted occurrence revealed different species-specific patterns of highly suitable habitat. These differences likely reflect different physiological or resource requirements between individual species and validate concerns over the utility of conservation targets based on aggregate species groups as opposed to a species-focused approach. Highly suitable habitats were poorly represented in MPAs with the most restrictions on extractive activities. This spatial mismatch possibly indicates a lack of explicit conservation targets and information on species distribution during the planning process. Non-extractive BRUVS provided a useful platform for building the suitability models across large scales to assist conservation planning across multiple maritime jurisdictions, and our approach provides a simple for method for testing the effectiveness of MPAs. © 2016, Society for Conservation Biology.},

	abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) have become key tools for describing and predicting species habitats. In the marine domain, environmental data used in modelling species distributions are often remotely sensed, and as such have limited capacity for interpreting the vertical structure of the water column, or are sampled in situ, offering minimal spatial and temporal coverage. Advances in ocean models have improved our capacity to explore subsurface ocean features, yet there has been limited integration of such features in SDMs. Using output from a data-assimilative configuration of the Regional Ocean Modeling System, we examine the effect of including dynamic subsurface variables in SDMs to describe the habitats of four pelagic predators in the California Current System (swordfish Xiphias gladius, blue sharks Prionace glauca, common thresher sharks Alopias vulpinus, and shortfin mako sharks Isurus oxyrinchus). Species data were obtained from the California Drift Gillnet observer program (1997-2017). We used boosted regression trees to explore the incremental improvement enabled by dynamic subsurface variables that quantify the structure and stability of the water column: isothermal layer depth and bulk buoyancy frequency. The inclusion of these dynamic subsurface variables significantly improved model explanatory power for most species. Model predictive performance also significantly improved, but only for species that had strong affiliations with dynamic variables (swordfish and shortfin mako sharks) rather than static variables (blue sharks and common thresher sharks). Geospatial predictions for all species showed the integration of isothermal layer depth and bulk buoyancy frequency contributed value at the mesoscale level ({\textless}100 km) and varied spatially throughout the study domain. These results highlight the utility of including dynamic subsurface variables in SDM development and support the continuing ecological use of biophysical output from ocean circulation models.},

	abstract = {A global expansion of satellite-based monitoring is making fisher behavioral responses to management actions increasingly observable. However, such data have been underutilized in evaluating the impacts of fishing on target and non-target fish stocks or the ramifications of management strategies on fishers. We demonstrate how vessel monitoring system (VMS) data can provide a suite of metrics (such as effort) for improving inputs to stock assessments, dynamic delineation of fishing grounds, and evaluation of regulatory or other (e.g., climatic) impacts on fisher performance. Using {\textgreater}1 million VMS records from the Gulf of Mexico grouper-tilefish demersal longline fishery, we first develop a generalized additive modeling approach that predicts fishing duration with ∼85\% accuracy. We combine model predictions with logbook data to compare the fishery before and after implementation of a suite of regulatory changes (e.g., a shift to catch share management). We find a large-scale reduction in fleet size, accompanied by reduced fishing effort (duration * number of hooks), shorter trips, lower operational expenses, higher catch rates, and more earnings for those vessels that remained in the fishery. We discuss how the combination of VMS and associated metrics can be expanded for use in management strategy evaluation, parameterizing economic models of fisher behavior, improving fishery-dependent stock assessment indices, and deriving socioeconomic indicators in fisheries worldwide.},

	abstract = {The effect of variability in targeting needs to be removed from catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data to estimate reliable abundance indices for multispecies fisheries. We test a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) that includes principal component scores (PCs) derived from the species composition in the catch, called the 'Direct Principal Component' (DPC) procedure, for its ability to remove the effect of variable targeting. Biomass trends are simulated for two multispecies, multi-habitat fishery scenarios: (i) four species distributed differentially across two habitats and (ii) ten species distributed differentially across four habitats. Tweedie distributed CPUE records are generated from the biomass trends for a fishery with constant targeting (control scenarios) and time-varying targeting (test scenarios). The DPC procedure is simulation-tested for its ability to estimate the underlying biomass trends for all species relative to the non-standardized CPUE index. The DPC procedure proved to be more accurate compared to nominal CPUE trends in the test scenarios. Even in the control scenarios, the DPC procedure offers greater accuracy for the estimated year effect by removing substantial variation from the data, with a small penalty on the accuracy of the underlying abundance trend. However, caution is advised if the DPC-derived index diverges noticeably from alternative models despite no indications for shifts in targeting. A selection procedure based on eigenvalues of the PCs is suitable to identifying the best-performing number of PCs to include in the GAM. The DPC procedure should be applicable for a variety of multispecies fisheries. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Quantifying the behavioural response of chondrichthyans to capture in longline fisheries can assist in understanding the physiological changes resulting from capture stress and ultimately aid in developing fishing practices that increase the survival of released bycatch species. Here, we evaluated the use of time-depth recorders (TDR) as a tool to quantify the amount of movement during capture across 42 animals from seven species of shark and one species of ray caught on hooks with TDRs attached in either a demersal or surface longline. Depth changes over time were analysed using three methods to estimate the percentage of time sharks and rays struggled on the line. Methods used were; 1) a Visual Assessment Method (VAM) of the TDR trace conducted by two investigators quantifying movement by summing the duration of movement bouts visually identified by erratic changes of depth; 2) the Gangion Extension Method (GEM) which quantifies movement by summing periods when captured animals altered their depth by {\textgreater} 50\% of the gangion length; and 3) the Vertical Excursion Method (VEM) which quantifies movement by summing periods when the absolute depth change between successive data points exceeded a threshold determined from the maximum depth change in the TDR data prior to capture of the animal. We found that the VAM was consistent across investigators and produced significantly higher estimates of movement than GEM and VEM. Estimates of movement from GEM and VEM were not significantly different to each other, but unlike GEM, VEM could be applied to TDRs used in both surface and demersal longlines. The amount of movement observed was different between species and such differences were consistent across all methods, indicating that species-specific behavioural responses to capture can be identified. The ability to assess capture behaviour using VEM allows inter-species comparisons, which may be used as a metric for rapid, generalised assessment of species' responses to longline capture where physiological data may be limited or lacking. Such assessments are important in the design of species-specific management for bycaught animals.},

	abstract = {This report demonstrates a method to rapidly assess the cumulative risk to sustainability of bycatch species of multiple fisheries. The method draws on other techniques already published in scientific literature and adds a new cumulative ranked estimate of total catch across multiple fisheries. The Ranked Risk Assessment of Multiple Fisheries (RRAMF) allows one to rank bycatch species data within each fishery and cumulate the ranks across multiple fisheries incorporating the relative impact of each fishery. Another feature of this study is that it does not present a single risk result for each species, rather it shows a range of scores based on a variety of combinations of double-weighted parameters used in the risk assessment. The RRAMF method was tested on the West Coast and Gascoyne Coast Bioregions of Western Australia using fishery independent data for general teleost and elasmobranch bycatch; and fishery dependent data for threatened, endangered and protected species (TEPS) (which also included the South Coast Bioregion). Bycatch in this study is defined as any discards from fishing events, and does not include by-product or target species unless the individuals are under/over size or above statutory catch limits. It is important to note that no score was above 48\% of the maximum possible score. All bycatch species received low to moderate risk scores using this method for the fisheries in these Bioregions. Those species that were most vulnerable to the cumulative impacts of fishing in these Bioregions were those species with sensitive biological life histories. That is, elasmobranchs and bottom dwelling brooders were ranked predominantly in the high end of the low-moderate risk category and into the moderate risk category. The RRAMF for the TEPS showed that while most species have high biological risk, the low interaction rates reported by fisheries maintained low to moderate risk categories for most species groups. Turtles and pinnipeds featured highly in the low-moderate to moderate risk categories, and Australian Sea Lions (Neophoca cinera) were the most vulnerable with a risk category ranging from moderate to moderate-high. This method uses transparent and repeatable methods that provide information for Ecosystem Based Fisheries Management (EBFM) at a Bioregional level. The method is limited by the availability of relevant and contemporary bycatch data and consequently the results generated require cautious interpretation.},

Here, we tested whether morphological similarity equated to similar age and growth patterns in two common coastal sharks in northern Australia. Vertebrae of 199 pig-eye (Carcharhinus amboinensis) and 94 bull (C. leucas) sharks were sourced principally from commercial fisheries operating along the Northern Territory coastline during 2007–2009. We sectioned vertebrae to provide estimates of age of these animals. Model averaging results indicated female pig-eye sharks matured at 13 years and lived .30 years. Theoretical asymptotic length (LN) (`s.e.) was estimated to be 2672 (`11.94) mm with a growth coefficient (k) of 0.145 year␣1. Male pig-eye sharks matured slightly earlier than females (12 years) and survived .26 years. Theoretical asymptotic length for males (LN) (`s.e.) was also smaller (2540 ` 13.056) mm and they grew faster (k  0.161 year␣1) than females. Bull sharks matured at 9.5 years and reached a maximum theoretical size (LN) (`s.e.) of 3119 mm (`9.803) with a similar growth coefficient (k  0.158 year␣1) to pig-eye sharks. Longevity of bull sharks was estimated to be more than 27 years. Our results indicate that these patterns of high longevity and slow growth are indicative of low resilience and high susceptibility to over-exploitation of these coastal sharks.},

Group (1) included species with slow growth rates (0.034 yr-1 {\textless} k {\textless} 0.103 yr-1) and extended longevity (26 yr {\textless} Tmax {\textless} 81 yr), e.g., shortfin mako Isurus oxyrinchus, dusky shark Carcharhinus obscurus, etc.; Group (2) included species with fast growth rates (0.103 yr-1 {\textless} k {\textless} 0.358 yr-1) and short longevity (9 yr {\textless} Tmax {\textless} 26 yr), e.g., starspotted smoothhound Mustelus manazo, gray smoothhound M. californicus, etc.; Group (3) included late maturing species (Lm/L∞ ≧ 0.75) with moderate longevity (Tmax {\textless} 29 yr), e.g., pelagic thresher Alopias pelagicus, sevengill shark Notorynchus cepedianus. The empirical equation for all data pooled was also developed. The λ’ values estimated by these empirical equations showed good agreement with those calculated using conventional demographic analysis. The predictability was further validated by an independent data set of three species. The empirical equations developed in this study not only reduce the uncertainties in estimation but also account for the difference in life history among groups. This method therefore provides an efficient and effective approach to the implementation of precautionary shark management measures.},

	abstract = {Reproductive parameters of three closely-related sympatric species of wobbegong (Orectolobus ornatus, O. maculatus and O. halei) off New South Wales (NSW) were investigated to contribute to a biological basis for the management of a commercial fishery targeting wobbegongs. Estimates of the onset of maturity based on ovary condition were 729 mm, 1117 mm, and 1591 mm total length (TL) for O. ornatus, O. maculatus and O. halei respectively. The length at which 50\% of the male population is mature based on clasper calcification was 803 mm, 1282 mm and 1784 mm TL for O. ornatus, O. maculatus and O. halei, respectively, and was similar to female onset of maturity based on uterus condition and to TL-at-maternity. These species of wobbegong had synchronous, triennial reproductive cycles. Follicles took 2 years to enlarge before ovulation. During the first year, follicles remained small, and then grew rapidly during the second year before ovulation during November. Gestation lasted  ̃10–11 months and parturition occurred during September–October. Mean litter sizes were nine (s.e. 0.5) and 21 (s.e. 1.5) for O. ornatus and O. maculatus, respectively, and increased with female total length in O. ornatus. Pregnant O. ornatus and O. maculatus were frequently caught in northern NSW and no pregnant wobbegongs, or females with large, yolky follicles were captured south of Sydney. Differences in the reproductive conditions of wobbegongs caught in northern and central NSW suggested geographically dependent reproductive behaviour. Knowledge of the reproductive parameters provided in this paper is necessary for adequate fisheries management and species conservation assessments.},

While the technique may have led to slight overestimation of age, particularly of dogfish from Hecate Strait, there is some corroboratin evidence for the Strait, of Georgia drawn from length-frequency distributions, sizes of fish in relation to reproductive stages, and assumptions about the average annual net uptake of Hg. It is tentatively concluded that the growth curve for female, expressed in terms of the von Bertalanffy equation, has parameters of K = 0.048, L = 125.3 cm, t Sub(0) = -4.88 yr. parameters suggested for male are: d = 0.070, L = 99.8 cm, and t Sub(0) = -4.70 yr.

Age and growth of S. zygaena was studied along a wide Atlantic region covering both the northern and southern hemispheres. Data from 304 specimens, caught between October 2009 and September 2014, ranging in size from 126 to 253 cm fork length (FL), were analysed. Growth models were fitted using the three-parameter von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF) re-parameterized to calculate L-0 (size at birth). Growth models were fitted to the sample data and data from several back-calculation models. The model fit to the quadratic modified Dahl-Lea back-calculated data seems to be the most appropriate to describe growth in this species, with resulting growth parameters of L-inf = 285 cm FL, k = 0.09 year(-1) for males and Linf = 293 cm FL, k = 0.09 year(-1) for females. Compared with other species of the same genus, estimated growth coefficients for S. zygaena seem to fall in the low to middle range. Although further work is still needed, this study adds to knowledge of the vital life-history parameters of smooth hammerheads in the Atlantic Ocean, which can be used in the management and conservation of this species.},

	abstract = {The determination of age for large, harvested species such as chondrichthyans is important to the estimation of growth and other key life history parameters such as natural mortality, age-at-maturity, longevity, and recruitment. Vertebrae from 760 wobbegongs (275 Orectolobus ornatus, 232 O. maculatus, and 253 O. halei) were collected between June 2003 and December 2007 at seven locations in eastern Australia (Queensland and New South Wales) to estimate growth parameters for these species. A multi-model inference (MMI) information theoretical approach including four candidate models, with back-calculated estimates of length in earlier life stages to account for limited numbers of pup and juvenile wobbegongs, was used to determine the most appropriate growth model for each species. The models that combined observed and back-calculated lengths-at-age did not provide a better fit than the model using observed lengths-at-age data only. Taking into account biologically meaningful estimations of L∞and k, the models with the best fit to the data were the logistic growth function for O. ornatus and O. halei, and the von Bertalanffy growth model for O. maculatus. Using these models, growth parameters obtained were: 999, 1630 and 2128mm total length for L∞and 0.19, 0.09 and 0.20 for k, while the maximum number of growth bands was 20, 22, and 27, for O. ornatus, O. maculatus, and O. halei, respectively. All three species were monomorphic, with similar growth rates for males and females. Verification and validation undertaken using edge and marginal increment analyses, as well as chemical marking of captive and wild wobbegongs, suggested that growth band deposition in orectolobids is more likely to be linked to somatic growth than seasonality. This study is the first to use chemically marked wild Orectolobiformes to investigate growth band deposition rate. Five orectolobid species have now been shown not to deposit growth bands following a synchronous annual pattern, in contrast to that inferred for most other chondrichthyan species. The growth parameters estimated in this study are crucial for stock assessments and for demographic analyses to assess the sustainability of commercial harvests. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Data on the length compositions and reproductive biology have been collected for Sphyrna lewini in Indonesian waters, in which this species makes an important contribution to the biomass of its artisanal and small-scale fisheries. These data were obtained by recording relevant body measurements and counts for this species while visiting Indonesian fish landing sites. The fish, which had been caught by gillnetting and longlining, covered a wide length range and included substantial numbers of immature, maturing and mature individuals. The vast majority of S. lewini {\textless}1100 mm total length (LT) had been caught by gillnetting, whereas most of those above this length had been obtained through longlining. The number of embryos in pregnant females, which ranged from 14 to 41, with a mean of 25, was positively correlated with the LT of those females. Birth occurred at c. 400 mm LT and predominantly in October and November. The number of females was similar to that of males among smaller fish, but far greater than that of males among larger fish. This presumably reflects a faster growth and greater longevity of females, selectivity of longlining for females and a tendency for males to move outside the area fished. For males, the relationships between clasper length and the extent of its calcification, and also with sexual maturation and LT have been determined. Females attained maturity (LT50) at a far larger size (2285 mm) than males (1756 mm). The LT of virtually all females and all males taken by gillnetting were less than their respective LT50 at maturity, and c. 67 and 51\% of the longline catches of females and males, respectively, were likewise immature. This feature, together with the substantial catches of S. lewini and the life cycle traits of elasmobranchs, suggest that this species is likely to be prone to overfishing in Indonesian waters. Furthermore, the removal of large numbers of this apex predator will presumably be affecting the trophic structure in the waters in which it is fished.},

First, the computation of FMC is performed using the marginal cost functions, most of which were developed by Ozbay et al. [Ozbay, K., Bartin, B., Berechman, J., 2001. Estimation and evaluation of full marginal costs of highway transportation in New Jersey. Journal of Transportation and Statistics 4 (1)]. FMC is defined and calculated as "total cost per trip" as explained in this paper. However, in multiple origin-destination and multiple route highway networks, the practical application of the network-wide FMC concept is complicated. These issues are addressed in detail in this paper. Therefore, in the second method, a multiple route based FMC approach is proposed for a given origin-destination pair in the network. It is observed that the marginal values of different paths vary as much as 28\%. Third, a comparison of FMC estimation results of two distinct measurement tools is presented. The FMC estimation is performed between a selected OD pair using the static transportation planning software output (TransCAD). The same analysis is repeated using the stochastic traffic simulation software output (PARAMICS). The differences in FMC values estimated by static transportation planning software and microscopic traffic simulation software are discussed. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

High levels of mercury and arsenic were found in shark blood at levels considered toxic in other vertebrates. Heavy metal concentrations were not related to body size or sex. Metal concentrations were not related to body condition with exception of copper, which was positively correlated. Protective effects of elements such as selenium, zinc, and iron were not detected.

We quantified patterns in catch rates and mean size for numerous tropical and subtropical species from 15 years of fishery-independent surveys (2002–2017) in northwestern Australia. This study region represents an area of  ̃0.8 million km2 which was closed to commercial shark fishing from 1993 or 2005 onward due to the very high State-wide catches of sandbar (Carcharhinus plumbeus) and dusky (Carcharhinus obscurus) sharks. A total of 43 shark and ray species were sampled, with sandbar shark being the most commonly caught species, followed by milk (Rhizoprionodon acutus), spot-tail (Carcharhinus sorrah), tiger (Galeocerdo cuvier), blacktip (Carcharhinus limbatus and Carcharhinus tilstoni), dusky and sliteye (Loxodon macrorhinus) sharks, and scalloped hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini). For sandbar shark, catch rates increased between 2008 and 2017 whereas for other taxa catch rates were mostly stable (albeit fluctuating). Mean size at capture fluctuated across years with no particular trends. Unlike for other parts of the world, catch rates and mean size of northwestern Australian sharks have been stable or increased in recent years. Though most shark species have conservative life histories, when science, management and enforcement work synergistically, sustainable resource use, recovery and conservation outcomes can all be achieved.},

	title = {Weight-length summaries for {Western} {Australian} fish species derived from surveys of recreational fishers at boat ramps},
	abstract = {Estimates of recreational catch from boat-based recreational fishers have been generated in Western Australia since 2011/12 using an integrated survey comprising off-site Phone-Diary Surveys, on-site Boat Ramp Surveys and Remote Camera Surveys. The primary purpose of the Boat Ramp Surveys is to determine an average weight for key species to convert estimates of recreational catch by numbers (determined from the Phone-Diary Survey) to harvest weight for comparison with catches from the commercial sector. Obtaining accurate weight-length data for fish (and other aquatic organisms) are also essential for many aspects of fisheries management, and have been an important component of this integrated survey. Boat Ramp Surveys were conducted in all four marine bioregions in Western Australia, by trained interviewers intercepting fishers as they returned from their fishing trips. Retained catches were measured and weighed using standardised techniques. The first survey in 2011/12 was a randomised design based on a fixed number of boat ramps. Subsequent surveys in 2013/14 and 2015/16 implemented a design that targeted high-use boat ramps in an effort to maximise the sample size for weight-length data. During the targeted design, interviewers travelled to selected high-use boat ramps in each Bioregion during periods of peak fishing activity (i.e., day type, time of day). The selection of high-use ramps was supported by data obtained from concurrent Remote Camera Surveys. The Boat Ramp Surveys provided a unique opportunity to collect weight-length data for a broad suite of species caught by boat-based recreational fishers in Western Australia. By collecting weight-length data concurrently with surveys of recreational fishing, it was not necessary to rely on external data sources (e.g., charter and commercial fishing), which are obtained from different spatial and temporal sampling frames. More than 27,000 fish (and other aquatic organisms) were measured and weighed during 8,000 interviews during the three Boat Ramp Surveys. Response rates were {\textgreater}97\%. Average weight and weight-length relationships were obtained for {\textgreater}50 of the top species within each resource. Data obtained from Boat Ramp Surveys provides appropriate indicators for species belonging to inshore and offshore demersal resources, where boats are required to access the resource. However, data were also collected for a variety of other species caught by boatbased recreational fishers, including species belonging to nearshore and estuarine resources. Weight-length data for some species were not obtained, or only obtained in small numbers, during the Boat Ramp Surveys, primarily due to aspects of the survey design (i.e., shorebased fishing not included and species such as Western Australian Salmon are caught predominantly from this platform), species preferences (i.e., Sea Mullet is only rarely caught using line fishing methods) and fisher preferences (i.e., rarely retain or target some commercially important species). Expanding biological surveys to include shore-based fishing will address some of these issues. Further investigation of any differences in weightlength data will provide additional guidance on the survey design, spatial and temporal scope, and frequency of future Boat Ramp Surveys.},

	abstract = {Concerns regarding quantifying fishing impacts on rarely-encountered bycatch species in a demersal fish trawl fishery in north-western Australia have raised issues with, 1) uncertainty associated with extrapolated estimates from low levels of coverage by human observers, and 2) appropriate minimum levels of observer coverage. This study used data collected from a very high level of independent observations (85\% coverage, n = 2127 trawls) using electronic monitoring (EM) to determine the uncertainty of extrapolated estimates of chondrichthyan, cetacean and reptile bycatch at different levels of observer coverage. The distribution of extrapolated estimates of total numbers for rarely-encountered bycatch (i.e. dolphins and hammerhead sharks) was asymmetric, with a higher tendency for overestimation at lower levels of observer coverage (≤ 25\%). Conversely, the minimum level of observer coverage required to achieve a reasonable level of precision (± 30\% or lower) for rarely-encountered species would need to be very high (≥90\%). Combining the interaction rates of rarely-encountered species (i.e. via statutory logbook validation) reduces the minimum level of observer coverage required to an achievable level ( ̃64\%), whilst maintaining relatively accurate (± 25\%) quantitative bycatch estimates for management purposes. Future programs need to consider that, in contrast to the infrequent presence of human observers, EM with cameras installed to monitor all fishing activity will effectively negate the need to assume that fishing practices are equivalent between observed and unobserved events. Hence, analysis of data collected by human observers may need to account for additional biases and/or imprecision along with the marked increase in uncertainty associated with lower levels of observer coverage.},

	abstract = {To improve bycatch mitigation of chondrichthyans, reptiles and cetaceans for a tropical demersal fish-trawl fishery, species-specific responses to bycatch reduction devices (BRDs) were investigated using both in situ subsurface and onboard observations. There are few, if any, studies that have determined mitigation performances of BRDs from subsurface interactions for these species, as most are rarely encountered and thus require substantial levels of observer coverage for robust assessments. This study combined in-net and onboard (774 day trawls and 1320 day trawl hours of subsurface observer coverage) electronic monitoring on all fish-trawl vessels (n = 3) to compare bycatch mitigation performances among nine megafauna groups, based on escape rates and interaction durations for three BRDs over 6 months (June to December 2012). Overall, 26.9\% of day trawls had no megafauna interactions and 38.3\% of the 1826 interactions escaped, with most in rapid time (91.4\% in ≤ 5 min). The upward inclined exclusion grid significantly improved the escape proportions for most chondrichthyans by 20-30\%. All BRDs were highly effective in reducing reptile (turtles and seasnakes) bycatch, but irrelevant for the few sawfish (n = 13) that readily entangled in the anterior of the net. Cetacean (bottlenose dolphins only) interactions with BRDs were very rare (n = 7) despite high levels of attendance and depredation during trawling. Loss of targeted teleosts through the BRD hatch was rare (1.3\% of day trawls). This relatively cost-effective method of electronic monitoring achieved very high levels of subsurface observer coverage (60\% of day trawls or 56\% of day trawl hours), and provided evidence that the subsurface expulsion of megafauna in poor condition is negligible. Furthermore, this study provides species-specific improvements toward bycatch mitigation strategies for demersal fish trawling.},

The trialing, implementation and validation of the efficiency of Bycatch Reduction Devices (BRDs) to limit the impact of the fishery on mobile marine fauna such as turtles, sea snakes, sharks and juvenile fishes is important, as is quantifying the impact on stock assessment models from adopting new and modified gear. The Shark Bay prawn and scallop fisheries use two grids types and the Exmouth Gulf fleet uses a standard grid for all boats. Prawn catch was reduced by 5-9 per cent on average in Shark Bay with grids, scallop catch was reduced by 9 per cent with prawn nets towing grids, and 95-100 per cent of turtles, larger sharks and rays were excluded by grids. In the Exmouth Gulf prawn fishery, overall net performance improved when grids were used. Fishers have accepted that grids are generally beneficial and recognised less sorting time, less handling large animals and improved product quality.},

	abstract = {There is a need to better understand the survivorship of discarded fishes, both for commercial stocks and species of conservation concern. Within European waters, the landing obligations that are currently being phased in as part of the European Union's reformed common fisheries policy means that an increasing number of fish stocks, with certain exceptions, should not be discarded unless it can be demonstrated that there is a high probability of survival. This study reviews the various approaches that have been used to examine the discard survival of elasmobranchs, both in terms of at-vessel mortality (AVM) and post-release mortality (PRM), with relevant findings summarized for both the main types of fishing gear used and by taxonomic group. Discard survival varies with a range of biological attributes (species, size, sex and mode of gill ventilation) as well as the range of factors associated with capture (e.g. gear type, soak time, catch mass and composition, handling practices and the degree of exposure to air and any associated change in ambient temperature). In general, demersal species with buccal-pump ventilation have a higher survival than obligate ram ventilators. Several studies have indicated that females may have a higher survival than males. Certain taxa (including hammerhead sharks Sphyrna spp. and thresher sharks Alopias spp.) may be particularly prone to higher rates of mortality when caught.},

Females (68-267 cm total length (TL); n = 183) and males (65-255 cm TL; n = 292) both matured at 8.3 years and 200 cm TL, which exceeds the maximum length of C. tilstoni. Vertebral ageing revealed that female and male C. limbatus lived to 22 and 24 years respectively, exceeding known longevity in C. tilstoni. The mean (±s.d.) intrinsic rate of population increase calculated using a Euler-Lotka demographic method was 0.11 ± 0.02 year-1 for C. limbatus, compared with 0.17 ± 0.02 and 0.20 ± 0.03 year-1 for two C. tilstoni stocks.

Data-limited stock assessments are increasingly used where model-based, data-rich approaches are not possible. However, their widespread use is constrained by several important limitations, especially the inability to estimate biomass or maximum sustainable yield (MSY)-based reference points. Here we applied several data-limited stock assessments and utilized expert opinion to identify early warning signs of depletion in the rapidly growing Southern California (CA) rock crab fishery, a small scale yet economically valuable fishery being managed with relatively limited information. We chose our specific assessment methods with the aid of a decision support tool (FishPath) designed to help identify context-appropriate options for assessing and managing fisheries. Results of five assessments indicated that serial depletion, regional overfishing, and effort creep may be occurring in the rock crab fishery. Expert opinion regarding changes in fishery operations and fishing effort provided vital insights for interpreting assessment results. We illustrate a general path for enhancing understanding of fishery impacts in a data-limited fishery, and sound rationale for proactive management to address warning signs of overfishing in the southern CA rock crab fishery.},

	abstract = {Effective conservation of marine ecosystems requires the assessment and management of cumulative impacts of multiple activities occurring in the ecosystem. Productivity Susceptibility Analysis (PSA) is a widely used tool to assess the potential impacts of fishing activities on marine ecosystems, particularly in data-poor regions. Yet, PSA and other risk-based approaches often do not account for the cumulative effects of multiple fisheries operating in the same region. Here we amend PSA to incorporate multiple fisheries by proposing a new index for cumulative risk assessment, i.e. Aggregated Susceptibility (AS). We applied this extended PSA to 81 species caught in 5 small-scale fisheries along the coast of Baja California, Mexico, and compared the results to the original PSA. Using the original PSA approach, 18 species (22.2\%) were scored as high risk, and twenty-five species (31\%) are at low risk from all of the fisheries conducted in this region. When the cumulative risk posed by all fisheries is assessed using our proposed methodology, the proportion of species at high risk increases to 38.3\%, whereas the proportion of species at low risk decreases to 21\%. For 13 species, the high-risk assessment is made only when scores are aggregated. Among the 5 fisheries, the set gillnet fishery has the greatest impact, which accounted for half of the high risk species and should be the focus of further investigation on how to best manage this fishery. Our analysis demonstrates the importance of accounting for the potential cumulative impacts of multiple co-occurring fisheries for the conservation of coastal marine ecosystems, identifies relative risk imposed by multiple fisheries, and provides a tool for a preliminary evaluation of the possible outcomes of management alternatives. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Age estimates were obtained from vertebral sections of 466 individuals spanning 50-308-cm total length. Maximum estimates of age for males and females were 25 and 31 years respectively. The three-parameter logistic model for females (L∞≤308cm LT, k≤0.15, ≤742) and for males (L∞≤317cm LT, k≤0.13, ≤782) provided the best fit to the size at age data. Males matured at a similar age (16 years), but smaller size than females (224v. 270cm LT). Growth parameters and age-At-maturity estimates were similar to those for genetically isolated C. brachyurus populations, and the sympatric dusky shark (C. obscurus). The southern Australian C. brachyurus population is long-lived, slow growing and late maturing. These growth parameters are needed to undertake demographic analyses to assess the resilience of C. brachyurus to fishing, and provide an example of a wide-ranging elasmobranch with similar life-history characteristics across isolated populations.},

Satellite telemetry data indicated lively school sharks survived the capture, on-board handling, tagging and release processes. Tracked school sharks mostly moved offshore and across the continental shelf in south to south-easterly directions. Depth habitat use reflected semi-pelagic behavioural traits and a preference for lower mixed layer depths of 50–100 m where water temperatures were 15–21 °C. Two PSATs provided data that we interpreted as indicative of tag and/or tagged shark ingestion, and tag regurgitation by endothermic predators. This study also identified an area where neonate and large, mature female school sharks were observed together during the Austral summer. Findings of this study are crucial to informing current fisheries management, stock recovery and bycatch mitigation strategies off southern Australia.},

A combination of their slow-growing nature and high use-values have resulted in population declines for many species around the world, and to date the vast majority of fisheries-related work on sharks has focused on the commercial sector. Shark recreational fishing remains an overlooked area of research despite the fact that these practices are popular globally and could present challenges to their populations. Here we provide a topical overview of shark recreational fisheries, highlighting their history and current status. While recreational fishing can provide conservation benefits under certain circumstances, we focus our discourse on the relatively understudied, potentially detrimental impacts these activities may have on shark physiology, behavior, and fitness. We took this angle given the realized but potentially underestimated significance of recreational fishing for shark conservation management plans and stock assessments, in hopes of creating a dialogue around sustainability. We also present a series of broad and focused research questions and underpin areas of future research need to assist with the development of this emergent area of research.},

Fishers regularly access both state and offshore Commonwealth waters but this offshore component of the recreational fishery is poorly understood. Our study tested the functionality of existing state-based surveys in Western Australia (WA) and New South Wales (NSW) to better inform Commonwealth fisheries and AMP managers about recreational fishing in their jurisdictions. Catch estimates for nine species of interest to the Commonwealth were developed and two case study AMPs [Ningaloo (WA) and The Hunter (NSW)] were also chosen to test the ability of the state survey data to be disaggregated to the park scale. As each state’s fishery survey designs were contextual to their own management needs, the application of the data to Commonwealth jurisdictions were limited by their statistical power, however aspects of each states surveys still provided useful information. Continued evolution of state-wide survey methods, including collection of precise spatial data, and regional over-sampling would be beneficial, particularly where there are multiple stakeholder and jurisdictional interests. National coordination, to temporally align state surveys, would also add value to the existing approaches.},

	abstract = {Indonesia has the greatest reported chondrichthyan catches worldwide, with c.110,000t caught annually. The pelagic thresher (Alopias pelagicus) and scalloped hammerhead (Sphryna lewini) together comprise about 25\% of the total catches of sharks landed in Indonesia. Age and growth parameters were estimated for A. pelagicus and S. lewini from growth-band counts of thin-cut vertebral sections. Alopias pelagicus (n = 158) and S. lewini (n = 157) vertebrae were collected from three Indonesian fish markets over a 5 year period. A multi-model analysis was used to estimate growth parameters for both species. The models of best fit for males and females for A. pelagicus was the three-parameter logistic (L∞ = 3169mm LT, k = 0·2) and the two-parameter von Bertalanffy models (L∞ = 3281mm LT, k = 0·12). Age at maturity was calculated to be 10·4 and 13·2years for males and females, respectively, and these are the oldest estimated for this species. The samples of S. lewini were heavily biased towards females, and the model of best fit for males and females was the three-parameter Gompertz (L∞ = 2598mm LT, k = 0·15) and the two-parameter Gompertz (L∞ = 2896mm LT, k= 0·16). Age at maturity was calculated to be 8·9 and 13·2years for males and females, respectively. Although numerous age and growth studies have previously been undertaken on S. lewini, few studies have been able to obtain adequate samples from all components of the population because adult females, adult males and juveniles often reside in different areas. For the first time, sex bias in this study was towards sexually mature females, which are commonly lacking in previous biological studies on S. lewini. Additionally, some of the oldest aged specimens and highest age at maturity for both species were observed in this study. Both species exhibit slow rates of growth and late age at maturity, highlighting the need for a re-assessment of the relative resilience of these two globally threatened sharks at current high levels of fishing mortality throughout the eastern Indian Ocean.},

	doi = {10.1111/faf.12076},
	abstract = {Recreational angling has been implicated in population declines of some marine and freshwater fish, but this activity is rarely considered as a threat or even halted when endangered species are targeted. Indeed, in some cases, anglers are drawn to fish for rare or endangered species. Conservation-oriented behaviours such as catch-and-release are often practiced voluntarily due to the ethics of anglers, yet even in these cases, some fishing mortality occurs. Nonetheless, there are many indirect conservation benefits associated with recreational angling. Here, we present a series of case-studies and consider whether catch-and-release angling for endangered fish is a conservation problem or a conservation action. If recreational angling activities contribute to population-level consequences that are contrary to recovery strategies, then angling for endangered species would seem to be a poor option. However, as revealed by several case-studies, there is much evidence that anglers are vocal and effective proponents of fish and habitat conservation, and for endangered species, they are often the only voice when other stakeholders are not engaged. Anglers may contribute directly to conservation actions via user fees (e.g. licences), philanthropic donations or by volunteering in research, education and restoration activities. However, it is important to quantify post-release mortality as well as understand the full suite of factors influencing a given population or species to know the potential risks. A risk assessment approach outlined in the paper may be used by managers to determine when the benefits of angling for endangered species outweigh the risks.},

	abstract = {Shark depredation, where a shark consumes a hooked fish before it can be retrieved to the fishing vessel, can occur in recreational fisheries. This may cause higher mortality rates in target fish species, injuries to sharks from fishing gear and negatively impact the recreational fishing experience. This study quantified spatial variation and frequency of shark depredation in a recreational fishery in the Ningaloo Marine Park and Exmouth Gulf, Western Australia, by surveying 248 fishing boats at west coast boat ramps and 155 boats at Exmouth Gulf boat ramps from July 2015 to May 2016. Shark depredation occurred on 38.7\% of fishing trips from west coast boat ramps and 41.9\% of trips from Exmouth Gulf boat ramps. The mean (±95\% CI) shark depredation rate per trip was 13.7 ± 3.3\% for demersal fishing (n = 185) and 11.8 ± 6.8\% for trolling (n = 63) for west coast boat ramps, compared to 11.5 ± 2.8\% (n = 128) and 7.2 ± 8.4\% (n = 27) for Exmouth Gulf ramps. Depredation rates varied spatially, with higher depredation in areas which received greater fishing pressure. A novel application of Tweedie generalised additive mixed models indicated that depth, the number of other boats fishing within 5 km and survey period influenced depredation rates for fishing trips from west coast boat ramps. For the Exmouth Gulf ramps, fishing pressure and decreasing latitude positively affected the number of fish depredated. These results highlight the important influence of spatial variation in fishing pressure. The occurrence of higher depredation rates in areas which receive greater fishing pressure may indicate the formation of a behavioural association in the depredating sharks. This study is the first quantitative assessment of shark depredation in an Australian recreational fishery, and provides important insights that can assist recreational fishers and managers in reducing depredation.},

Surprisingly, for many countries this kind of jurisdictionally and/or ecologically assigned data had not been readily available before then. Since the release of these spatialized data, this material has had major influence on how fisheries are perceived by policy makers in various countries and by the global scientific community, as well as by a growing list of other stakeholders such as non-governmental environmental organizations and the general public. Here, the Sea Around Us updates the fisheries science, policy, conservation and management audience on the extensively modified spatial allocation method and a substantially improved new website. Also, this contribution points to and describes the much improved catch data underlying this website. These data now account for catches for all countries in the world by fisheries sectors (industrial, artisanal, subsistence, recreational), after augmenting the officially reported landings data through the inclusion of comprehensively reconstructed data of previously unreported catches and major discards, for every maritime country or territory in the world, and their Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Also presented are the extensively improved spatial allocation procedures which assign global catch data to the 180,000 half degree spatial cells used by the Sea Around Us to subdivide the global ocean. The reconstructed data for 1950-2010 for all countries in the world and the High Seas, freely accessible and downloadable through the Sea Around Us web portal, will be updated regularly. It is hoped that these revised data and the substantially improved web utility will invigorate and assist the debate about the role of fisheries in a global framework as well as in national food security settings.},

	abstract = {Worldwide, many shark populations are classified as data poor, making it difficult to assess their status. However, for many sharks, their longevity, late maturation and low production of pups make them highly vulnerable to exploitation and highlight the need to assess their status. We compared reference points and stock status estimated from full stock assessments for 33 shark populations with those derived analytically, empirically or through simulation. There was excellent agreement between overfished status estimated from an assessment and determined from analytical methods using life history and an index of abundance; in 70\% of cases, the analytical estimate of status was robust to assumptions of initial index depletion. We reviewed the ratio between fishing mortality at MSY (FMSY) and natural mortality (M) for chondrichthyans, from published studies and shark stock assessments. We then compared conclusions on overfishing status from the stock assessments to those derived with FMSY proxies and found very good agreement. Finally, we conducted a simulation study across representative life-history parameters and different fishery selectivity patterns to explore the resulting range of FMSY to M ratios. As a rule of thumb, FMSY should not exceed 0.20M for low productivity stocks, 0.50M for stocks of intermediate productivity and 0.80M for the most productive shark stocks when immature individuals are harvested, which is the norm in the vast majority of cases examined. A triage method is proposed that provides a roadmap for using these data-limited methods as an initial step towards assessment of stock status and sustainability of chondrichtyans.},

Less than 25\% of the shark catch reported to the FAO is identified below the genus level; the other 75\% is lumped into categories such as “sharks”, “rays”, or “elasmobranchs nei”, (not elsewhere included). This study evaluates the taxonomic resolution of domestic elasmobranch landings in the Mediterranean and Black Seas, where over half of shark and ray species are threatened with extinction, but data deficiency and ambiguity consistently limit conservation action. A Taxonomic Resolution Index (TRI) was calculated for the landings of 24 countries over 65 years (1950–2014) to evaluate the quality of catch reporting over time. The TRI revealed that less than a quarter of commercial elasmobranch taxa are represented in Mediterranean and Black Seas landings data, and reporting quality has hardly improved.

	abstract = {The Gulf of California (GC) is one of the most historically important regions in Mexico for shark fisheries. However, detailed historical shark landings are not available, making it difficult to plan adequate management strategies. This study analyses historical trends in GC shark fishery landings in a data-poor environment to establish a baseline for future research and assessments. The total shark landings for the artisanal fishery from 1939 to 2014, middle-size vessel fishery landings for the 1988–2014, and species composition from 1960 to 2014 were estimated, and we assessed the uncertainty inherent in the data sources and subsequent analyses. Thirty-eight shark species were identified in the GC artisanal fishery, of which Mustelus spp., Sphyrna lewini, Rhizoprionodon longurio, Squatina californica, Carcharhinus falciformis, Sphyrna zygaena, and Carcharhinus limbatus were the taxa with the greatest landings. A noticeable decline in landings was observed for Carcharhinus leucas, Nasolamia velox, Negaprion brevirostris, Sphyrna spp., Carcharhinus altimus, Carcharhinus obscurus, Galeocerdo cuvier, Carcharhinus porosus, Triakis semifasciata, and Carcharhinus brachyurus. Landings of the pelagic sharks Prionace glauca, Alopias pelagicus, and Isurus oxyrinchus increased after 1986, mainly due to the development of the middle-size vessel fishery. The history of GC shark fisheries and implications for management of sustainable shark fisheries are discussed.},

	doi = {10.3389/fmars.2017.00320},
	abstract = {The remote Pitcairn Island Group in the South Pacific was designated one of the world's largest marine reserves in 2016, encompassing some of the few remaining near-pristine areas within EEZ boundaries. Pitcairn's domestic fisheries are small-scale, and consist mainly of subsistence (non-commercial) and limited artisanal (commercial) catches. There is no locally-based industrial (large-scale commercial) fishery and the level of foreign industrial activity in recent times has been minimal, due in part to the low biomass of commercially valuable species, along with economic constraints of the EEZ's geographic isolation. Using a catch reconstruction method we estimated the total domestic marine catches for the Pitcairn Islands from 1950 to 2014. We show that overall the Pitcairn Islands' small-scale fisheries catches were almost 2.5 times higher than the data reported by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations on behalf of the Pitcairn Islands, however, this primarily reflects discrepancies prior to the 1980s. Overall, catches for the subsistence and artisanal sectors started with around 12 t·year-1 in 1950, but declined to 4 t·year-1 by 2014. Domestic reconstructed subsistence catch levels were entirely driven by changes in the human population on the island, with reconstructed artisanal catches only occurring in recent years (2000 onwards). Industrial fishing is entirely executed by foreign vessels, this catch is considerably variable throughout the years and ceases entirely in 2006. The implementation of one of the world's largestmarine reserves surrounding the offshore waters of Pitcairn Island has been specifically designed not to affect the rates of subsistence and artisanal fishing conducted by the resident population. Although there is no industrial fishing in the Pitcairn EEZ at present, climate change is predicted to influence the routes of migrating commercially-targeted species, potentially altering fishing effort levels and shift target fishing zones. Implementation of MPAs such as the Pitcairn Island Marine Reserve protect large oceanic areas from risk of future industrial exploitation, whilst protecting near-shore reef and deep-water zones, maintaining domestic coastal fisheries vital for local communities.},

	abstract = {Many of the world's shark populations are in decline, indicating the need for improved conservation and management. Well managed and appropriately located marine parks and marine protected areas (MPAs) have potential to enhance shark conservation by restricting fisheries and protecting suitable habitat for threatened shark populations. Here, we used shark occurrence records collected by commercial fisheries to determine suitable habitat for pelagic sharks within the Australian continental Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and to quantify the amount of suitable habitat contained within existing MPAs. We developed generalised linear models using proportional occurrences of pelagic sharks for three families: Alopiidae (thresher), Carcharhinidae (requiem), and Lamnidae (mackerel) sharks. We also considered aggregated species from the Lamnidae and Carcharhinidae families (‘combined sharks’ in the models). Using a set of environmental predictors known to affect shark occurrence, including chlorophyll-a concentration, salinity, sea surface temperature, and turbidity, as well as geomorphological, geophysical, and sedimentary parameters, we found that models including sea surface temperature and turbidity were ranked highest in their ability to predict shark distributions. We used these results to predict geographic regions where habitat was most suitable for pelagic sharks within the Australian EEZ, and our results revealed that suitable habitat was limited in no-take zones within MPAs. For all shark groupings, suitable habitats were found mostly at locations exposed to fishing pressure, potentially increasing the vulnerability of the pelagic shark species considered. Our predictive models provide a foundation for future spatial planning and shark management, suggesting that strong fisheries management in addition to MPAs is necessary for pelagic shark conservation.},

	volume = {75},
	issn = {10959289},
	doi = {10.1093/icesjms/fsy031},
	abstract = {Effective fisheries management generally requires reliable data describing the target species' life-history characteristics, the size of its harvested populations, and overall catch estimates, to set sustainable quotas and management regulations. However, stock assessments are often not available for long-lived marine species such as sharks, making predictions of the long-term population impacts of variable catch rates difficult. Fortunately, stage- or age-structured population models can assist if sufficient information exists to estimate survival and fertility rates. Using data collected from the bronze whaler (Carcharhinus brachyurus) fishery in South Australia as a case study, we estimated survival probabilities from life tables of harvested individuals, as well as calculated natural mortalities based on allometric predictions. Fertility data (litter size, proportion mature) from previous studies allowed us to build a fertility vector. Deterministic matrices built using estimates of life-table data or natural mortality (i.e. harvested-augmented and natural mortality) produced instantaneous rates of change of 0.006 and 0.025, respectively. Assuming an incrementing total catch at multiples of current rates, stochastic simulations suggest the relative rate of population decline starts to become precipitous around 25\% beyond current harvest rates. This is supported by a sharp increase in weighted mean age of the population around 25\% increase on current catches. If the catch is assumed to be proportional (i.e. a constant proportion of the previous year's population size), the relative r declines approximately linearly with incrementing harvest beyond the current rate. A global sensitivity analysis based on a Latin-hypercube sampling design of seven parameters revealed that variation in the survival estimates derived from the life tables was by far the dominant (boosted-regression tree relative influence score = 91.14\%) determinant of model performance (measured as variation in the long-term average rate of population change r). While current harvest rates therefore appear to be sustainable, we recommend that fisheries-management authorities attempt to sample a broader size range of individuals (especially older animals) and pursue stock assessments. Our models provide a framework for assessing the relative susceptibility of long-lived fishes to harvest pressure when detailed stock data are missing.},

Carbon-14 results were plotted relative to YOF for comparison with regional Δ14C reference chronologies to assess the accuracy of age estimates. Results from the WNA validated vertebral age estimates up to 12 years, but indicated that ages of large adult sharks were underestimated by 11-12 years. Age was also underestimated for adult sharks from the SIO by 14-18 years. Validated lifespan for C. taurus individuals in the present study reached at least 40 years for females and 34 years for males. Findings indicated that the current age-reading methodology is not suitable for estimating the age of C. taurus beyond ∼12 years.

This factor is used in fisheries science to adjust for the gradual increase in the effectiveness of fishing gear resulting from the successive introduction of technological improvement to fishing gear and vessels. Altogether, 51 estimates of this creep factor, mostly around 2–4\%/yr and covering periods from 4 to 129 yr, were assembled or newly calculated from secondary data and shown to decrease as the period covered increased. This finding is compatible with the hypothesis that creep factors are usually estimated and published to correct for the introduction of an effective new technology over a short period of time. We suggest that estimates obtained in this fashion cannot be applied to long-term analyses and propose instead our empirical relationship, derived from estimates of creep factor and the number of years covered in a study. Also, our study confirms that technology creep must be included in all analyses involving time series of fishing effort, particularly if they exceed one decade in temporal coverage.},

To assist the regional fishery management councils in determining vulnerability, NMFS elected to use a modified version of a productivity and susceptibility analysis (PSA) because it can be based on qualitative data, has a history of use in other fisheries, and is recommended by several organizations as a reasonable approach for evaluating risk. A number of productivity and susceptibility attributes for a stock are used in a PSA and from these attributes, index scores and measures of uncertainty are computed and graphically displayed. To demonstrate the utility of the resulting vulnerability evaluation, we evaluated six U.S. fisheries targeting 162 stocks that exhibited varying degrees of productivity and susceptibility, and for which data quality varied. Overall, the PSA was capable of differentiating the vulnerability of stocks along the gradient of susceptibility and productivity indices, although fixed thresholds separating low-, moderate-, and highly vulnerable species were not observed. The PSA can be used as a flexible tool that can incorporate regional-specific information on fishery and management activity.},

	abstract = {The majority of the world's fisheries, by number, are data-poor/limited, and there is a growing body of literature pertaining to approaches to estimate data-limited stock status. There are at least two drivers for assessing the status of data-limited fisheries. The first is to try to understand and report on the global or regional status of fisheries across many stocks. The second is to attempt to assess individual data-limited stocks, for status reporting and/or guiding management decisions. These drivers have led to attempts to find simple, generic, low-cost solutions, including the broad application of generically parameterised models, and the blanket application of a single, or limited number of possible, analytical approach(es). It is unclear that generic methods function as intended, especially when taken out of their original design context or used without care. If the intention is to resolve individual stock status for the purposes of management, there is concern with the indiscriminate application of a single method to a suite of stocks irrespective of the particular circumstances of each. We examine why caution needs to be exercised, and provide guidance on the appropriate application of data-limited assessment methods (DLMs). We recommend: (a) obtaining better data, (b) using care in acknowledging and interpreting uncertainties in the results of DLMs, (c) embedding DLMs in harvest strategies that are robust to the higher levels of uncertainty in the output of DLMs by including precautionary management measures or buffers and (d) selecting and applying DLMs appropriate to specific species’ and fisheries’ data and context.},

	abstract = {Matrix population models (MPMs) are powerful tools for translating demographic and life history information into a form that can be used to address a wide range of research topics, such as projecting population dynamics, evaluating stressor impacts on populations, and studying life history evolution. However, the reliability of such studies depends on the MPM being constructed in a way that accurately reflects the species’ life history. We highlight three errors commonly encountered in published MPMs: (1) failing to include survival in the fertility coefficient; (2) introducing a one-year delay in age at first reproduction; and (3) incorrectly calculating the growth rate out of a stage class. We review the sources of such errors and provide new analyses revealing the impact of such errors on model predictions, using lionfish and American alligator models as examples. To quantify the prevalence of such errors we examined and scored the original publications underlying the models in the COMADRE Animal Matrix Database. The first two errors were found in 34\% and 62\%, respectively, of the published studies; nearly all were in models that used a “postbreeding census” representation of the life cycle (in which newborns—eggs, neonates, fledglings, etc.—are explicitly included). Of the studies where stages may last longer than one time step, 53\% constructed the growth rate using inappropriate formulas for estimating the asymptotic population growth rate or its sensitivity to demographic parameters. These results suggest that further efforts may be required to educate biologists on the construction of MPMs, perhaps in concert with the development of new software tools. Furthermore, the conclusions of many studies that are based on MPMs may need to be re-examined, and synthetic studies using the COMADRE Database need to be accompanied by careful examination of the underlying studies.},

	abstract = {Harvest strategy approaches based around empirical indicators and/or control rules are beginning to be accepted in a growing range of data- and capacity-poor fisheries. While there is an increasing body of work around developing empirical indicators and control rules in data-poor contexts, this has typically been done on a case-specific basis. There remains a need for general guidance on formulating control rules that link empirical indicators with suitable management responses. Additionally, in the data-poor context, most literature has focused on empirical indicators and assessments, with less focus on decision rules and the incorporation of indicators and assessments in a harvest strategy framework. This review considers a range of harvest strategy options, focusing on empirical indicators and decision rules available for data-poor species and fisheries. These clearly illustrate that a paucity of information is not a reason to avoid developing harvest strategies, and that a range of pragmatic approaches are available regardless of the available data, life-history of the target species, nature of fishing operations, or the available research capacity. There is considerable scope for further work in this field, but arguably there is a comprehensive repository of approaches and decision rules that, when combined with the guidelines, form a solid foundation and toolkit for all but the most data-poor species and fisheries.},

	abstract = {A general northward shift in marine species distributions has been observed in the western North Atlantic Ocean, which may have significant ecological consequences. Large coastal sharks can have wide migratory distributions but show fidelity to specific nursery habitats. Here we show evidence for nursery range expansion into Pamlico Sound, North Carolina by a marine apex predator, the Bull Shark (Carcharhinus leucas). Previous assessments have shown little to no use of estuarine North Carolina waters as nursery habitat by Bull Sharks from 1965-2011. Juvenile sharks were rarely captured in a fishery-independent gillnet survey conducted by the North Carolina Division of Marine Fisheries (NCDMF) from 2003-2011, but were present every year from 2011-2016. Juvenile Bull Shark presence in the Sound was strongly related to early summer temperatures and late summer salinities, which have increased in the estuary over the 13 survey years, and further evidence for increasing water temperatures in Pamlico Sound was found in a 45-year data set for the NCDMF estuarine trawl survey. These results suggest that increasing water temperature and salinity have allowed Bull Sharks to expand their nursery habitat. This shift will have unknown, but potentially strong, impacts on both the local ecosystem and interactions with humans.},

	abstract = {Sharks and their cartilaginous relatives (Class Chondrichthyes, herein ‘sharks’) are one of the world's most threatened species groups. Their slow life history traits and vulnerability to capture make them particularly susceptible to overfishing, and they are widely caught in both target and by-catch fisheries. Fisheries management measures that can effectively reduce shark fishing mortality are urgently required to halt population declines and species extinctions. We provide an overview of typical measures for understanding and managing risks to sharks, and highlight critical gaps relating to incorporating socio-economic factors in to research and management. We argue that neglecting these factors hinders effective shark conservation, and has negative consequences for people. We emphasise the importance of a holistic approach, which explicitly considers socio-economic factors in decision-making. Based on this, we propose the first framework for assessing feasibility in a shark management context, which could be integrated with traditional fisheries risk assessments in order to bridge this gap. This framework considers key dimensions of the costs, benefits and overall enabling environment for shark management in a given fishery. Overall, managers and policy makers must consider socio-economic factors in shark conservation efforts to deliver better outcomes for sharks and people. Our simple feasibility framework can support this by enabling costs, benefits and context to be explicitly considered in planning and policy-making, alongside the typical biological and technical risks to sharks in fisheries.},

Following onset of the program in the 1960s, catch rates in new installations in subsequent decades occurred at a substantially lower rate, indicating regional depletion of shark populations over the past half a century. Concurrent declines in body size and the probability of encountering mature individuals suggests that apex shark populations are more vulnerable to exploitation than previously thought.

While it is typically applied in data-rich circumstances, its suitability in data-limited situations is investigated in this work. Two " Simple Stock Synthesis" (SSS) approaches are outlined, each developed to mimic the Depletion-Based Stock Reduction Analysis (DB-SRA) estimation of overfishing limits (OFLs) currently applied to data-limited U.S. west coast groundfish species. SSS-MC uses Monte Carlo draws of natural mortality, steepness, and stock depletion and estimates initial recruitment, while SSS-MCMC estimates natural mortality, steepness, and initial recruitment while fitting to an artificial abundance survey representing stock depletion with an error distribution equivalent to the stock depletion prior used in DB-SRA. These approaches are applied to 45 species of unassessed groundfishes in the Pacific Fishery Management Council Groundfish Fishery Management Plan, and the OFL estimates are compared to corresponding DB-SRA estimates. Despite model structure and parameter specification differences, SSS led to results comparable to DB-SRA over a wide range of species and life histories. SSS models with sex-specific life history parameters and growth variability are also presented as examples of how the inherent flexibility of SS can be used to account for more uncertainty in derived quantities. SSS-MCMC, while exhibiting statistically undesirable traits due to the inclusion of the artificial survey, readily includes data-informed abundance surveys into an assessment framework consistent with more complex, data-informed assessments. Establishment of viable data-limited approaches in SS is a convenient first steps in " building-up" stock assessments towards fuller implementation in SS when additional data become available, while also providing a way to inform management in data-limited situations. © 2012.},

Existing methods for estimating mesh selectivities are reviewed, and an alternative method, which overcomes some problems in the existing methods, is described. In this method, an assumed selectivity function is fitted directly to catch data for a number of different mesh sizes, with the parameters of the selectivity function being estimated simultaneously across mesh sizes and length-classes. The new method is used to estimate selectivities for the gummy shark data, on the assumption that the selectivity function takes the shape of a gamma distribution. Data from the 2- and 3-in. mesh nets did not satisfy the assumptions of the procedure, but estimates of mesh selectivities were successfully obtained for the 4-9-in. mesh nets. © 1986 CSIRO.

There may be scope to apply current data-limited assessment models in these fisheries. The Length-Based Spawning Potential Ratio (LB-SPR) model requires only fish length data and input estimates of key life history parameters. LB-SPR has been seldom applied in inland systems, partly due to the current model assumption of asymptotic fishing gear selection, characteristic of trawls. In contrast, most inland fisheries operate gillnets or hooks, having dome-shaped selection curves. This is problematic because the largest size classes of fish are not fully retained by the gear, but their absence in the catch will be assumed by the LB-SPR model to reflect fishing mortality. LB-SPR was extended to include dome-shaped selection. Case study assessments were undertaken using survey gillnet catches of brown trout Salmo trutta from four Irish lakes. Bayesian Monte Carlo methods were used to quantify uncertainty around estimates of life history parameters for each stock. Despite small sample sizes, the model produced estimates of SPR that corresponded to expert knowledge of stock status. The extended LB-SPR can be applied to assess data-limited inland fish stocks, and other stocks for which selection is dome-shaped.},

	abstract = {The regulation of mesh size is important for the effective and sustainable management of fisheries using gillnets, which are the main fishing gear used in artisanal elasmobranch fisheries throughout northwestern Mexico. Gillnet selectivity studies focusing on elasmobranchs have generally evaluated the impact on target species, and information on bycatches remains scarce. This study assessed the impact of gillnet selectivity on both target elasmobranch species and bycatches, by varying the mesh size of gillnets. Sampling was performed from 2009 to 2015 in five artisanal fishing grounds located along the northwestern coast of Mexico. The species composition and ecological parameters of the elasmobranch communities that were caught, as well as the size structure and estimated selectivity models for the main species caught, were compared between four mesh sizes: 10.16, 15.24, 20.32 and 25.4 cm (stretched opening). Overall, 32 elasmobranch species were caught, nine of which were common to all mesh sizes. Our results indicate that the species composition of the catch varied with mesh size. While the small-sized sharks Mustelus californicus and M. henlei were the main species caught by gillnets with the smaller mesh sizes, the guitarfish Pseudobatos productus and Zapteryx exasperata, and the Pacific angel shark Squatina californica were the main species caught gillnets with the largest mesh sizes. Gillnet selectivity was estimated for these latter four species as well as for the horn shark Heterodontus francisci. Optimum length for these species varied widely, increasing proportionally to mesh size. These findings emphasize the difficulty of determining an optimal minimum mesh size for multi-species fishery in this area. Finally, recommendations for future directions according to the species’ vulnerability to fishing are discussed, focusing on the development of effective strategies to initiate or strengthen the recovery of elasmobranchs of the northwestern coast of Mexico.},

	abstract = {The bottom-fish stocks of the Main Hawaiian Islands (MHI) are intensively fished, both commercially and recreationally. Recent assessments of the Bottomfish Management Unit Species (BMUS) complex suggested overfishing, and expressed concerns about missing non-commercial data. We used reported commercial time-series data and estimation ratios to indirectly estimate non-commercial catches for non-pelagic species (i.e., excluding tuna and billfishes) for 1950-2005. Using adjustment ratios, we also accounted for commercial under-reporting, which suggested that total commercial non-pelagic catches were 28-128\% higher than reported commercial catches for any given year. Estimated non-commercial catches for 1950-2005 were 2.1 times higher than reported commercial catches. Reported catches underestimated likely total catches (reported and un-reported commercial plus non-commercial) of non-pelagic species and BMUS components for 1950-2005 by a factor of 3.9 and 2.9, respectively. We incorporated the reconstructed BMUS non-commercial catches into stock assessments of the officially reported commercial BMUS catches via a Schaefer production model. Total catch increased by 2.5-3.5 times with the addition of non-commercial BMUS catch estimates, which in turn increased model estimates of MSY and carrying capacity (k) by approximately four times compared to analyses with reported commercial data alone. As the CPUE data lacked information to resolve the confounding between large, unproductive and small, productive stocks, an informative prior was used for fishing mortality rate to attain MSY (FMSY). To address uncertainty in key management parameters, independent estimates of exploitation rate, or fisheries independent estimates of abundance, and informative trends in recreational effort or catches are required. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {With the increasing popularity of recreational angling around the world, there is a need to better understand the potential contribution of recreational fishing to reported shark population declines. However, the nature and perception of shark encounters – a fundamental precursor to future research, management and conservation measures aimed to increase shark survival – is not well documented in recreational fisheries. Five hundred and ninety recreational saltwater anglers responded to the survey and reported their experiences targeting or incidentally catching sharks, as well as their attitudes toward sharks, shark fishing techniques, and shark conservation and management. The survey found sharks were caught regularly, with 57\% of respondents commonly targeting sharks and 93\% of respondents having caught a shark at least once. Eighty-eight percent of the respondents released the last shark that they caught and most respondents often or always practised catch-and-release when catching sharks. The survey revealed that avid anglers have positive attitudes toward sharks and shark conservation and have a desire to handle and release sharks in ways that will increase their likelihood of survival. However, the survey also revealed that there are a variety of situational factors (e.g. target fish, fishing platform) that influence the choices that anglers make while fishing, which may influence adherence to catch-and-release methods. Based on their positive attitudes toward sharks, recreational anglers may be strong allies for the development, dissemination, and adoption of species and situational-specific best practice catch-and-release guidelines for this group of fishes within the wider recreational saltwater angling community.

Knowledge of the shark species involved is fundamental to developing effective management strategies to mitigate the impacts of depredation. Identification of the species responsible is difficult as direct observation of depredation events is uncommon and evaluating bite marks on fish has a high degree of uncertainty. The use of trace DNA techniques has provided an alternative method for species identification. We demonstrate proof of concept for a targeted DNA barcoding approach to identify shark species using trace DNA found at bite marks on recovered remains of hooked fish. Following laboratory validation, forensic analysis of swabs collected from samples of bitten demersal fish, led to the definitive identification of shark species involved in 100\% of the incidences of depredation (n = 16).},

In response, conservation measures have been applied at differing scales, often severely restricting sales of declining species. Therefore, DNA barcoding was used to investigate sales of shark products in fishmongers and fish and chip takeaways in England. The majority of samples were identified as Spiny Dogfish (Squalus acanthias), which is critically endangered in the Northeast Atlantic and landings have been prohibited (although there is evidence of importation of this species). Significant differences in the species sold between retailer types were also identified, suggesting differing supply chains. The results underline issues surrounding the use of ‘umbrella’ sales terms where many species are labelled with the same designation. This denies consumer choice as purchasers cannot easily avoid declining species or those associated with high levels of toxicants. For the first time in Europe, minibarcodes are also used to identify species from dried shark fins. Despite a small sample size, analysis of UK wholesaler fins identified threatened sharks, including the endangered and CITES listed Scalloped Hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini). This highlights the global nature of the damaging trade in endangered shark species, in which Europe and the UK have a continuing role.},

Exposing Port Jackson sharks Heterodontus portusjacksoni and Australian swellsharks Cephaloscyllium laticeps to 30 min of simulated gill-net capture elicited behavioral stress (struggling and elevated ventilation rate) and minor physiological stress (elevated plasma lactate) responses but did not cause any mortality. Sedation of Australian swellsharks affected some stress-related blood variables. Repeated handling of Port Jackson sharks and Australian swellsharks at short intervals may result in elevated stress levels, but repeated exposure to simulated capture does not affect the physiological response of these two species to the treatment.

Observations on maximum oocyte diameter indicate that ovulation occurs at 1.7 - 1.8 cm, and oocytes of this diameter were recorded throughout the study. Additionally, females with egg-cases in utero were also observed throughout the year, indicating a protracted breeding season, although peak egg-laying occurred in May, and was minimal in October. Gonad indices indicated that the male and female gonadal cycles were not synchronous, supporting the idea that females store spermatozoa. Based on this and previous studies, it appears that there are geographical variations in certain aspects of the reproductive biology. Vertebral bands were enhanced using an acid decalcification technique, and for the purpose of the study, bands were assumed to be annual in nature. The von Bertalanffy equation was estimated as lt = 82.7(1-e-0.15(t+1.36), and was similar to a length-frequency generated equation calculated for dogfish in Spanish waters.},

Shortly afterovulation, females move inshore where they spend the first year of pregnancy in shallow water (50 m depth).During the second year the majority migrate back to deep water (200–300 m) where parturition, mating, and ovulation take place. Litter size and length of young at birth increase linearly with parent length. Number of young ranges from 1 to 16. On average, males mature at 58 cm; females mature at 71.5 cm off Otago, but at 74.5 cm off Banks Peninsula and Kaikoura. Maximum observed lengths were 11cm for females and 90 cm for males. Reproductive failures were high compared to northern hemisphere populations, and comprised addled eggs, females resting between pregnancies, and non‐developing uterine eggs. © Crown copyright 1988.},

The values of steepness were estimated using several combinations of life history parameters for North Pacific shortfin mako to elucidate whether the numerical approach could identify reasonable values for fundamental life history parameters as well as steepness. The results of the numerical approach indicated that the mean values of steepness and their 95\% confidence intervals were highly sensitive to combinations of values for growth rate, maturity ogive, longevity, reproductive cycle, and natural mortality rate. Meanwhile, the most plausible combinations of the biological parameters and values of steepness were identified based on the numerical approach with biological knowledge. The mean values and their standard deviation (SD) for steepness with the Beverton-Holt-SRR model were 0.353 (SD=0.057) and 0.273 (SD=0.046) for 2- and 3-year reproductive cycles, respectively. The numerical approach therefore has high potential to become an important tool for estimating SRR in elasmobranchs such as lamniform sharks, and the application of this approach to other elasmobranchs could greatly contribute to improvements in stock assessment and management.},

The accuracy of trend estimates will depend on where and how many locations within a species' range are sampled. We ask how the spatial extent of sampling interacts with non-linear patterns in long-term trends to affect estimates of decline in standardised catch of tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) on the east coast of Australia. We apply a Bayesian trend model that uses prior information on life-history traits to estimate trends where we use data from all regions versus spatial subsets of the data. As more regions were included in the model the trend estimates converged toward an overall decline of 71\% over three generations. Trends estimated from data only from northern regions or southern regions underestimated and overestimated the regional decline, respectively. When a subset of regions was modelled, rather than the full data-set, the prior informed by life-history traits performed well, as did a weakly informed prior that allowed for high variation. The rate of decline in tiger sharks is consistent with a listing East Coast Australia tiger sharks as endangered under local legislation. Monitoring programs that aim to estimate population trends should attempt to cover the extremes and mid-points of a population's range. Life-history information can be used to inform priors for population variation and may give more accurate estimates of trends that can be justified in debates about the status of threatened species, particularly when sampling is limited.},

Here we show, using a big-data approach that combines satellite-tracked movements of pelagic sharks and global fishing fleets, that 24\% of the mean monthly space used by sharks falls under the footprint of pelagic longline fisheries. Space-use hotspots of commercially valuable sharks and of internationally protected species had the highest overlap with longlines (up to 76\% and 64\%, respectively), and were also associated with significant increases in fishing effort. We conclude that pelagic sharks have limited spatial refuge from current levels of fishing effort in marine areas beyond national jurisdictions (the high seas). Our results demonstrate an urgent need for conservation and management measures at high-seas hotspots of shark space use, and highlight the potential of simultaneous satellite surveillance of megafauna and fishers as a tool for near-real-time, dynamic management.},

Our analysis supports two Mustelus clades, one comprising species with no white spots and a placental reproductive mode and a second clade of white spotted, aplacental species. Levels of genetic divergence are low, especially among species in the white spotted, aplacental clade and this should be taken into account when employing molecular data to delineate species. Our data support the hypothesis of a radiation following dispersal from a northern hemisphere ancestor. Molecular dating suggests that localised speciation in Australasia may have occurred during the Pleistocene.

Estimates of mean rmax, across the different natural mortality methods, varied from 0.03 to 0.59 year-1 among the nine species, but generally increased with increasing maximum size. Comparing these estimates to rmax values for other species of chondrichthyans, the species Rhynchobatus australiae, Glaucostegus typus, and Glaucostegus cemiculus were relatively productive, while most species from Rhinobatidae and Trygonorrhinidae had relatively low rmax values.

To identify where the animals may occur in greater numbers, this study used the major commercial fishery datasets in the region, containing nearly 180 000 catch records from 1990 to 2017. Several general patterns were evident. Sawsharks occurred at shallower and deeper depths than previously thought, and their geographical range was larger than documented in previous studies. Depth distributions of both species overlapped, but P. cirratus appeared more common in deeper water (at depths up to 500 m), with peak common sawshark catch rates at ∼400 m. Seasonal standardised catch patterns across fishing methods suggested that migrations from deeper to shallower waters may occur in the Australasian autumn and winter. The greatest concentration of sawsharks, inferred by standardised catch rates, occurred to the east and west of Bass Strait between Tasmania and mainland Australia. Although standardised catch rates of sawsharks declined in gill-net fisheries by ∼30\%, primarily in the Bass Strait and Tasmania, sawsharks appear to be caught at consistent rates since the 1990s, inferring a possible resilience of these sharks to current levels of fishing pressure.},

All five species are classified as highly threatened with extinction: three are Critically Endangered (smalltooth sawfish Pristis pectinata, largetooth sawfish Pristis pristis, and green sawfish Pristis zijsron); two are Endangered (narrow sawfish Anoxypristis cuspidata, and dwarf sawfish Pristis clavata). Sawfishes are threatened primarily due to a combination of their low intrinsic rates of population increase, high catchability in fisheries, and high value. Sawfishes are among the world's largest marine fishes, and they are caught by a wide range of fishing gears owing to their tooth-studded rostra being easily entangled. Sawfish fins are some of the most valuable for shark fin soup, and their rostra have long been traded as curios. In addition, they inhabit shallow coastal waters, estuaries, and rivers of the tropics and subtropics, down to a maximum depth rarely exceeding 100 m and are associated with threatened mangrove and seagrass habitats. Historically, sawfishes were distributed in the coastal waters of 90 countries and territories. Over the past century, their geographic distribution has been greatly diminished. For example, the smalltooth sawfish is now found in {\textless}20\% of its former range. Globally, sawfishes are now entirely absent from 20 countries; 43 countries have lost at least one species. Sawfishes are legally protected, to some degree, in 16 of the 90 range states. These safeguards encompass, on average, 81\% of their Extant distribution; however, the quality and breadth of protection varies dramatically across countries and species. Smalltooth sawfish currently has the least amount of such coverage of only half (49\%) of Extant distribution. The global conservation strategy specifies actions to protect sawfish and their habitats. Such actions are urgently warranted to avoid global extinction and to restore robust populations for the benefit of coastal ecosystem function and biodiversity.},

Despite regular landings, little is known about their lifespan. To assess the age of P. cirratus, we first assessed their vertebral morphology to determine the best method for band pair elucidation. Based on morphology, vertebrae located in the post-branchial region were identified as the largest and least variable for band pair analysis. A total of eight different age-determination methods were then applied to shark vertebrae from this region to test the viability of traditional and nontraditional techniques in elucidating band pairs. Band pairs were indeterminable across all treatments. This research calls for further work into age validation and development of novel techniques to accurately age sawsharks.},

	abstract = {The fauna of the Galápagos Island chain is characterized by high biodiversity and endemism. Thus, the conservation of its terrestrial and marine wildlife, including the sustainable management of local fisheries, is of paramount importance. Although the commercial exploitation of fish in the Galápagos did not intensify until the mid-1900s, issues of overexploitation and mismanagement are already of serious concern. However, to date, research on Galápagos fisheries has been largely species or island specific, and no long-term cumulative catch statistics exist. In this study, total landings associated with the industrial and artisanal fisheries of the Galápagos Islands were compiled and analysed in an effort to assess accurately the amount of seafood that has been extracted from this region over the last six decades. The total catch for all sectors from 1950-2010 was 797 000t, of which industrially caught tuna made up 80\%. The results also show a high degree of fishing down within the in-shore ecosystem catch, whereby planktivorous mullets have replaced high trophic level groupers within the past three decades. This shift has coincided with the spatial expansion of the Galápagos fishing fleet to areas further off-shore, where predatory species are not yet depleted. In addition to legally caught and exported seafood, Galápagos waters are also prone to illegal fishing.

	abstract = {Commercial fisheries catches by country are documented since 1950 by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Unfortunately, this does not hold for marine recreational catches, of which only few, if any, estimates are reported to FAO. We reconstructed preliminary estimates of likely marine recreational catches for 1950–2014, based on independent reconstructions for 125 countries. Our estimates of marine recreational catches that are retained and landed increased globally until the early 1980s, stabilized through the 1990s, and began increasing again thereafter, amounting to around 900,000 t⋅year–1 in 2014. Marine recreational catches thus account for slightly less than 1\% of total global marine catches. Trends vary regionally, increasing in Asia, South America and Africa, while slightly decreasing in Europe and Oceania, and strongly decreasing in North America. The derived taxonomic composition indicates that recent catches were dominated by Sparidae (12\% of total catches), followed by Scombridae (10\%), Carangidae (6\%), Gadidae (5\%), and Sciaenidae (4\%). The importance of Elasmobranchii (sharks and rays) in recreational fisheries in some regions is of concern, given the life-history traits of these taxa. Our preliminary catch reconstruction, despite high data uncertainty, should encourage efforts to improve national data reporting of recreational catches.},

	abstract = {© 2020 CSIRO. The Carcharhinidae is one of the most at-risk shark families in the Indo-West Pacific (IWP), which is a global priority for the conservation of elasmobranchs. Of the 57 described species of carcharhinids, 43 are known from the IWP, where many are subject to high fishing pressure. Many of these species are also found outside this bioregion. Understanding the connectivity of individual species across their ranges is paramount to successful management of their fisheries. Studies of population genetic structure have been the mainstay for assessing connectivity. Here, we review 41 studies pertaining to the population genetic structure of 20 species of carcharhinid whose ranges include the IWP and for which relevant data are available. The genetic markers used range from microsatellite loci and small mitochondrial DNA sequences (375 to 4797 bp) to genomic analyses. Overall, the population genetic structure for these carcharhinids was varied but patterns emerged according to the lifestyle of the species, with the greatest structure shown by species that are highly habitat dependent and the least structure shown by oceanic species. Experimental designs of the underlying studies have, however, often been opportunistic with small sample sizes, few locations sampled and based on analysis of single mitochondrial regions and/or few microsatellite markers. The literature provides a basis for understanding the population genetic structure of IWP carcharhinids, but future research needs to focus on the application of population genomics and more robust experimental design so that population genetic structure can be quantified with higher certainty and resolution over finer spatial scales.},

	abstract = {The lower Chesapeake Bay is the largest summer nursery for sandbar sharks Carcharhinus plumbeus in the western Atlantic. The objective of this study was to define essential fish habitat for juvenile sandbar sharks in this estuary. The longline survey conducted by the Virginia Institute of Marine Science was expanded from 1990 to 1999 to include ancillary stations throughout the Virginia portion of Chesapeake Bay to delineate this nursery spatially. We analyzed catch per unit of effort data from 83 stations as a function of nine physical and environmental variables using tree-based regression models. The highest abundance of juvenile sandbar sharks was predicted where salinity was greater than 20.5 (practical salinity scale) and depth was greater than 5.5 m. The models also suggested that dissolved oxygen concentration may influence shark distribution. To increase applicability of the models to management practices, we introduced distance to the mouth of the estuary as a surrogate variable for salinity. The models estimated that the highest abundance of sharks was in areas less than 34.5 km from the mouth of the estuary and in depths greater than 5.5 m. The areas of the estuary that met the criteria of the models, based on the threshold values of the variables, were mapped spatially in a geographic information system. The resulting response surfaces were interpreted to represent essential nursery habitat for sandbar sharks in Chesapeake Bay. Both models performed very well using several dependent and independent measures to estimate their classification and predictive ability. We used logistic regression with presence/absence data to validate the tree models. The logistic regression models agreed very well with the tree-based regression models, selecting the same variable combinations to predict sandbar shark presence and absence. *},

	abstract = {Marine social-ecological systems are constantly changing, and fishers who make a living from working the seas are continually adapting in response to different sources of variability. One main way in which fishers can adapt to ecosystem change is to change the fisheries they participate in. This acts to connect fisheries, creating interlinked networks of alternative sources of income for fishers. Here, we synthesize fisheries data and construct fisheries connectivity networks for all major ports in the US California Current Large Marine Ecosystem. Fisheries connectivity networks are comprised of nodes, which are fisheries, connected by edges, whose weights are proportional to the number of participating vessels. Fisheries connectivity networks identify central fisheries in the US California Current Large Marine Ecosystem, specifically Dungeness crab and Spiny Lobster, and systematic topological differences, e.g. in network resilience and modularity. These network metrics directly relate to the social vulnerability of coastal fishing communities, especially their sensitivity and capacity to adapt to perturbation. Ultimately, improving knowledge of fisheries connectivity is vital if policy makers are to create governance institutions that allow fishermen to adapt to environmental, technological and management change while at the same time enhancing the social and economic value of fisheries. In doing so, new policies that account for fisheries connectivity, will lead to improved sustainable fisheries management, and enhanced socioeconomic resilience of coastal communities.},

The von Bertalanffy growth model, an alternative equation of the von Bertalanffy growth model with a size-at-birth intercept, the Gompertz growth model, and a logistic model were fitted to sex-specific observed size-at-age data. Considering the statistical criteria (e.g., lowest mean square error [MSE], high coefficient-of-determination, and greatest level of significance) we desired for this study, the logistic model provided the best overall fit to the size-at-age data, whereas the von Bertalanffy growth model gave the worst. For "biological validity," the von Bertalanffy model for female sharks provided estimates similar to those reported in other studies. However, the von Bertalanffy model was deemed inappropriate for describing the growth of male spinner sharks because estimates of theoretical maximum size (L∞) indicated a size much larger than that observed in the field. However, the growth coefficient (k = 0.14/yr) from the Gompertz model provided an estimate most similar to that reported for other large coastal species. The analysis of growth for spinner shark in the present study demonstrates the importance of fitting alternative models when standard models fit the data poorly or when growth estimates do not appear to be realistic.},

Recently, electronic (archival) data storage tags (DSTs) have successfully been used to reconstruct the movements of free-ranging demersal fish between release and recapture. Data from DST experiments allow the calculation of fisheries-independent migration parameters, and thereby provide a means of evaluating conventional tagging data. We compared the migration patterns of North Sea plaice (Pleuronectes platessa L.) as inferred from a database of twentieth century conventional tagging experiments (CT), with data from 132 plaice tagged with DST. In general, the CT experiments allowed a reliable interpretation of migration patterns, although for certain release areas the migration distances were biased due to the heterogeneous distribution of fishing effort. © 2004 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

Existing shark fishery legislation was compiled by political entity and regional fishery management organizations (RFMO). The mean observed M fw:M r ratio for all species was 3·0\%, but actual fin to body-mass ratios varied considerably by species and location. Species-specific mean ratios ranged from 1·1 to 10·9\%, and estimated mean ratios ranged from 1·5 to 6·1\% by country, depending on fin-cutting practices and the mix of exploited species.

We developed a participatory multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to prioritise 141 fished stocks in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, based on their importance to fisheries management. The approach aimed to: (1) structure the decision problem, (2) force consideration of management objectives at the stock level, (3) balance trade-offs generated by competing objectives, and (4) balance differences in the perceived importance of objectives among fisheries managers. Performance scores and criteria weightings for ten management objectives were elicited from two groups of managers (commercial and recreational), combined into a total performance value for each stock, and ordered to infer priority for assessment. Stocks with higher total performance values typically had an exploitation status of Overfished, Growth-overfished, or Uncertain and were subject to a catch quota, because these criteria were weighted highly by both management groups. However, total performance was more sensitive to differences in weightings between management groups than to variations in relative magnitude of weightings among criteria. The priority list of stocks will assist decisions regarding the optimal allocation of resources for fisheries research in NSW. This MCDA approach is adaptive and can incorporate changes in management priorities through time and additional ecosystem components.},

	abstract = {© 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature. Many shark species are at risk of overexploitation due to their high economic value, slow maturation, and low recruitment compared to most teleosts. However, there is insufficient knowledge about population structure at different spatial scales necessary to optimise fisheries models. We used single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) obtained through complexity-reduction genome sequencing to quantify the population structure of two highly mobile and commercially fished shark species: bronze whalers (Carcharhinus brachyurus) and dusky sharks (C. obscurus). We applied a comprehensive approach to test several population-structure hypotheses and signal consistency across methods and marker type. We found that C. obscurus was panmictic across Australia and Indonesia and across the Indian Ocean to South Africa based on neutral loci, whereas for C. brachyurus, the westernmost Australian samples appeared to be separate from the rest. The southernmost east Australian samples indicated some difference from the rest of Australia and New Zealand based on candidate loci for C. brachyurus, and potentially also C. obscurus; however, the lack of a reference genome makes the interpretation difficult. Despite similar patterns in both species, subtle and potentially important structure differences emphasise the importance of studying each target species independently rather than assuming similar patterns from closely related species with similar dispersal abilities, as well as considering different marker types in future studies. We found evidence of connectivity across the regions sampled, suggesting that the cumulative effects of regional fisheries and the potential for cross-jurisdictional fishery assessments and management should be considered for Australian, Indonesian, and New Zealand populations.},

	abstract = {Commercial catches taken in southwestern Australian waters by trawl fisheries targeting prawns and scallops and from gillnet and long-line fisheries targeting sharks were sampled at different times of the year between 2002 and 2008. This sampling yielded 33 elasmobranch species representing 17 families. Multivariate statistics elucidated the ways in which the species compositions of elasmobranchs differed among fishing methods and provided benchmark data for detecting changes in the elasmobranch fauna in the future. Virtually all elasmobranchs caught by trawling, which consisted predominantly of rays, were discarded as bycatch, as were approximately a quarter of the elasmobranchs caught by both gillnetting and longlining. The maximum lengths and the lengths at maturity of four abundant bycatch species, Heterodontus portusjacksoni, Aptychotrema vincentiana, Squatina australis, and Myliobatis australis, were greater for females than males. The L50 determined for the males of these species at maturity by using full clasper calcification as the criterion of maturity did not differ significantly from the corresponding L50 derived by using gonadal data as the criterion for maturity. The proportions of the individuals of these species with lengths less than those at which 50\% reach maturity were far greater in trawl samples than in gillnet and long-line samples. This result was due to differences in gear selectivity and to trawling being undertaken in shallow inshore waters that act as nursery areas for these species. Sound quantitative data on the species compositions of elasmobranchs caught by commercial fisheries and the biological characteristics of the main elasmobranch bycatch species are crucial for developing strategies for conserving these important species and thus the marine ecosystems of which they are part.},

	abstract = {Ornate angel sharks were sampled from commercial catches from the Great Australian Bight trawl fishery during the period from February 1992 to February 1993. Size structure, reproduction and diet were studied. Both sexes exhibited similar length-weight relationships. Morphological data indicate that the most accurate conversion to total length (TL) would be obtained from the distance between the granular ocelli on the trunk near the pectoral fins. Males reached sexual maturity at a TL of 810-910 mm, females at 1150-1250 mm. The male:female ratio was 1:3 for the post partum population and 1:1 for embryos. Both ovaries were functional throughout the year, but the left ovary contained more ovarian follicles than the right. Follicle diameters ranged from 1 to 68 mm; the largest follicle was found during autumn, before ovulation, the smallest during spring, after ovulation. Eighteen near-term embryos from four females were observed during January and February 1993. The number of young per female ranged from 2 to 9. It appears that S. tergocellata has a minimum gestation period of 6-12 months and parturition may occur biennially. The most common stomach contents were squid (Notodarus gouldi) and fish (mainly Monacanthidae).},

	abstract = {Sharks are important apex predators in marine systems but many populations have experienced large declines, which has resulted in adverse effects on marine food webs. Sharks are also economically important, as their fins are valued in Asian markets. In response to concerns about declining shark populations, a number of nations, including Australia, have developed national plans of action for their conservation and management. As part of New South Wales' (NSW) efforts to understand the characteristics of their shark fishery, data were collected on the depth of capture, species, sex, body length and weight, fin weight, and reproductive status of individuals caught in the NSW commercial 'large shark' demersal set-line fishery. We created models of the relationship between fin to body weight and wastage (discarded or low value portions of the carcass) and compared the ratios of whole, landed, trimmed, and fin weight to determine the relationship between fin weight and wastage to length by species. Our results indicate that length, sex, and the interactions between length with species and sex account for differences in the relative fin weight of sharks; whereas species, length, and their interaction account for differences in the proportion of a shark carcass that is wasted. The data reveal that catching smaller sharks will increase relative fin weight and decrease wastage. Given these results, we recommend that managers consider weight ratio data information in their decision making to promote a sustainable and profitable shark fishery.},

Very few discarded elasmobranch species have been assessed for their associated fates. Here we describe the immediate mortality of several threatened species discarded from gillnets deployed off eastern Australia to target key carcharhinids and white sharks, Carcharodon carcharias (within an objective of protecting bathers) and causal factors for abundant elasmobranchs. In total, 420 animals comprising at least 22 species were gillnetted with a total immediate mortality of 49 \% and group-specific estimates of 100 \% for dolphins (n = 8), 100 \% for teleosts (n = 16), 86 \% for sharks (n = 75), 45 \% for turtles (n = 20) and 36 \% for rays (n = 301). Among elasmobranchs, species that were obligate ram-ventilating (e.g. great hammerhead, Sphyrna mokarran and common blacktip shark, Carcharhinus limbatus) had greater mortality ({\textgreater}95 \%) than those species with spiracles, and likely capable of some stationary respiration (e.g. whitespotted guitar fish, Rhynchobatus australiae, whitespotted eagle ray, Aetobatus ocellatus, Australian cownose ray, Rhinoptera neglecta and to a lesser extent, pygmy devilray, Mobula kuhlii cf. eregoodootenkee) (16–74 \% mortality). Mortalities among Australian cownose rays increased across longer soaks. The effect of soak time was further assessed to determine an optimal to maintain gillnet efficiency for target sharks, but minimise the absolute mortality of abundant rays and was estimated at up to three or four fishing nights (72–96 h). Other potential operational modifications, including using light and better retroactive deterrents to reduce turtle and dolphin bycatches and mortality, warrant investigation.},

Pre-stress standard and routine metabolic rates (MR) of individuals of these species were measured and compared to the MR obtained after simulated gillnet capture. Standard MRs of M. antarcticus and H. portusjacksoni were 168.5 ± 61.9 mgO2 kg-0.67 h−1 and 144.1 ± 20.4 mgO2 kg-0.67 h−1, respectively. Routine MRs of M. antarcticus and H. portusjacksoni were 202.6 ± 63.5 mgO2 kg-0.67 h−1 and 166.4 ± 11.2 mgO2 kg-0.67 h−1, respectively. The simulated gillnet-capture treatment decreased the MR of M. antarcticus by 59.3\% and increased that of H. portusjacksoni by 21.6\%. Our results confirm that M. antarcticus is highly sensitive to gillnet capture, exhibiting significant variability in MR among individuals and also a high delayed mortality rate. We interpret the decrease in MR as a compensatory mechanism for reducing oxygen consumption to cope with the stress imposed by capture. Mortality in this species was associated with higher pre-stress MR, and lower post-stress MR. In contrast, H. portusjacksoni showed mild increases in MR. Their resilience to capture stress most likely relies on effective buccal pumping and lower basal MR. A mixed-effects model approach permitted us to identify the main sources of variation in the MR measured, which were the individual differences, treatment effects, species variations and delayed mortality. The comparative approach employed in this work allowed us to understand and provide reliable estimates of the effects of fishing on the MRs of these two species.},

We determined contemporary rates and levels of discards in global tuna fisheries. An estimated 265 279 t (52 283 to 478 275 t 95\% CI) is annually discarded by global tuna fisheries, composing about 5\% of the weight of the total catch. Pelagic longline and purse seine fisheries contributed about 64 and 36\% of discards, respectively. Other gear types composed {\textless}1 \% of discards. Discards in tuna fisheries are now 63\% lower than estimated 1 decade earlier, mainly due to large declines in discards in longline tuna fisheries, possibly from increased retention of formerly discarded species and sizes of catch and increased gear selectivity. The decline also resulted, in part, from employing different methods to categorize caught sharks whose fins were retained and carcasses discarded following processing. Discard rates were greater in shallow- than deep-set longline fisheries, and higher in purse seine sets associated with fish aggregating devices and other floating objects than in other purse seine set types. The quality and availability of data on discards in global tuna fisheries were extremely limited. Filling gaps in monitoring, improving observer data fields and collection protocols, and providing public access to amalgamated discard data held by fisheries management organizations will improve the certainty of future discard estimates, supporting effective management of discards in global tuna fisheries.},

Bycatch is defined as non-targeted species and small or damaged target species. Bycatch species composition, main species length, sex ratio and the fate of the most common species are presented first. Stratified ratios relative to landings of major commercial tunas were then used to estimate the total bycatch; these ratios were considered the most appropriate variable for extrapolation. Stratification was based on the fishing mode (free school vs. floating object), season (quarters) and spatial areas. The annual average bycatch was estimated at about 6400 t, corresponding to a mean annual value of 80.8 t per 1000 t of tuna landed or 7.5\% of the total catch. Tunas represent 83\% (67.2 t/1000 t) of the total bycatch, followed by other bony fishes (10\%, 7.8 t/1000 t), billfishes (5\%, 4.0 t/1000 t), sharks (1\%, 0.9 t/1000 t) and rays (1\%, 0.9 t/1000 t).

This requires data on a combination of measures, including reported landings, retained and discarded non-target catch, and post-discard survival. Identification of the factors influencing discard versus retention is needed to improve catch estimates and to determine wasteful fishing practices. To do this, retention rates of elasmobranch non-target catch in a broad subset of fisheries throughout the world were compared by taxon, fishing country, and gear. A regression tree and random forest analysis indicated that taxon was the most important determinant of retention in this dataset, but all three factors together explained 59\% of the variance. Estimates of total elasmobranch removals were calculated by dividing the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) global elasmobranch landings by average retention rates, and suggest that total elasmobranch removals may exceed FAO reported landings by as much as 400\%. This analysis is the first effort to directly characterize global drivers of discards for elasmobranch non-target catch. The results highlight the importance of accurate quantification of retention and discard rates to improve assessments of the potential impacts of fisheries on these species.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of the age, growth and demography of an organism can be quite useful for managing its fishery. However, for many elasmobranch species, no valid estimates of age, growth and therefore age-specific mortality and natality rates are available. Thus, even though the distribution, abundance, habits and reproduction of a population may be known, no reliable estimates of population growth are possible. As a result, detailed demographic analysis has been completed for only a few shark species (e.g. the California leopard shark, Triakis semifasciata). All age-determination techniques attempted for the Pacific angel shark (Squatina californica) have met with difficulties. Recently, however, we have accumulated data on 69 tag-recaptures and have used this information to model a von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF) to predict the growth of this commercially exploited shark species. We performed a demographic analysis of this species, which yielded a net reproductive rate (Ro) of 2-25, a generation time (G) of 14'5 years, and an estimate of the instantaneous population growth coefficient (r) of 0-056 year-1, assuming that only natural mortality (M) was occurring, estimated to be 0-2 year-1. When reasonable estimates of fishing mortality (F) are included in the survivorship function, Rq and r are reduced considerably. Presently, Pacific angel sharks first enter the fishery at the same size and age at which they first reproduce. Until accurate estimates of M and F are available, it would be prudent to set a size limit considerably above the size at first reproduction to protect the Pacific angel shark in California. © 1992 CSIRO.

	abstract = {To assess the exploitation status of marine resources and to formulate scientific advice for fisheries management, reliable fishery data are required. When dealing with data-poor stocks, like skates and rays (Rajiformes) caught by multispecies and multigear fisheries in Portugal, strategies need to be defined to surpass data limitations, like species misidentification and the lack of fishing gear information in landings data. This paper presents a stepwise statistical procedure, involving factor analysis for mixed data and flexible discriminant analysis, to estimate the total number of trips and the correspondent total landed weight by species. Interviews and self-sampling that took place under a pilot study (2011 – 2013) focused on skate and ray fisheries showed that collaborative research is a low cost and valuable tool to improve our knowledge on fisheries and their catches and may contribute to increase the accuracy. Given the persistence of species misidentification errors in the official statistics, the procedure here presented is currently used to report the Portuguese annual estimates of species-specific landed weight. This procedure may be considered to be applied to data deficient fishery bycatch resources for which dedicated sampling programs are not priority.},

	abstract = {The smooth hammerhead shark, Sphyrna zygaena, is a pelagic shark occasionally captured as bycatch by industrial pelagic longline fleets in the Atlantic Ocean. Data for this study were collected by fishery observers, between 2003 and 2016. Datasets analyzed included information on catches per unit effort (CPUE), size and sex of smooth hammerhead sharks bycaught by the Portuguese pelagic longline fishery in the Atlantic Ocean. A total effort of 2 523 288 hooks yielded 638 sharks, ranging in size from 123 to 275 cm fork length. Larger sharks tended to occur in open ocean habitats and smaller specimens in coastal areas. Results confirmed the wide latitudinal range of the species (45 °N–35 °S), although CPUE was higher closer inshore within the Tropical North and Equatorial regions. An overall sex ratio of 1.4 males for each female was observed, with more males in both inshore and offshore waters. Significant differences in CPUE and size distribution were found between regions, years and quarters of the year. Mean CPUE increased and mean specimen size decreased in the Equatorial region from 2012 onwards. In order to remove fishery-dependent effects from CPUE data, a Tweedie Generalized Linear Model (GLM) was used to create a relative index of abundance (standardized CPUE). The index showed some oscillations in the initial years (2008–2010), followed by a decreasing trend until 2013 and then an increasing trend in more recent years, until 2016. The distributional patterns and indicators presented in this study provide a better understanding of the smooth hammerhead shark's spatio-temporal dynamics and population structure in the Atlantic Ocean and can be used to improve management and conservation measures for this species.},

	abstract = {Fishery by-catch, especially discarded by-catch, is a serious problem in the world's oceans. Not only are the stocks of discarded species affected, but entire trophic webs and habitats may be disrupted at the ecosystem level. This paper reviews discarding in the marine fisheries of the USA; however, the type, diversity and regulatory mechanisms of the fisheries are similar to developed fisheries and management programmes throughout the world. We have compiled current estimates of discarded by-catch for each major marine fishery in the USA using estimates from existing literature, both published and unpublished. We did not re-estimate discards or discard rates from raw data, nor did we include data on protected species (turtles, mammals and birds) and so this study covers discarded by-catch of finfish and fishable invertebrates. For some fisheries, additional calculations were required to transform number data into weight data, and typically length and weight composition data were used. Specific data for each fishery are referenced in Harrington et al. (Wasted Resources: Bycatch and discards in US Fisheries, Oceana, Washington, DC, 2005). Overall, our compiled estimates are that 1.06 million tonnes of fish were discarded and 3.7 million tonnes of fish were landed in USA marine fisheries in 2002. This amounts to a nationwide discard to landings ratio of 0.28, amongst the highest in the world. Regionally, the southeast had the largest discard to landings ratio (0.59), followed closely by the highly migratory species fisheries (0.52) and the northeast fisheries (0.49). The Alaskan and west coast fisheries had the lowest ratios (0.12 and 0.15 respectively). Shrimp fisheries in the southeast were the major contributors to the high discard rate in that region, with discard ratios of 4.56 (Gulf of Mexico) and 2.95 (South Atlantic). By-catch and discarding is a major component of the impact of fisheries on marine ecosystems. There have been substantial efforts to reduce by-catch in some fisheries, but broadly based programmes covering all fisheries are needed within the USA and around the world. In response to international agreements to improve fishery management, by-catch and discard reduction must become a regular part of fishery management planning. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {The world's most endangered marine cetacean, the vaquita (Phocoena sinus), continues to be caught in small-mesh gillnet fisheries throughout much of its range. We monitored fishing effort and incidental vaquita mortality in the upper Gulf of California, Mexico, from January 1993 to January 1995 to study the magnitude and causes of the incidental take. Of those factors studied, including net mesh size, soaktime, and geographic area, none contributed significantly to the incidental mortality rate of the vaquita, implying that the principal cause of mortality is fishing with gillnets per se. The total estimated incidental mortality caused by the fleet of El Golfo de Santa Clara was 39 vaquitas per year (95\% CI = 14, 93), over 17\% of the most recent estimate of population size. El Golfo de Santa Clara is one of three main ports that support gillnet fisheries throughout the range of the vaquita. Preliminary results indicate that fishing effort for San Felipe, Baja California, is comparable to that of El Golfo de Santa Clara, suggesting that this estimate of incidental mortality of vaquitas represents a minimum. We strongly recommend a complete and permanent ban on gillnets in the area. Alternative or supplemental mitigation strategies include (1) a maximum annual allow able mortality limit of vaquitas; (2) mandatory observer coverage of all boats fishing within the Upper Gulf of California and Colorado River Delta Biosphere Reserve; (3) extension of the Upper Gulf of California and Colorado River Delta Biosphere Reserve to encompass all known vaquita habitat; (4) rigorous enforcement of new and existing regulations; and (5) development of alternative sources of income for gillnet fishers.},

	abstract = {Waters of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, are home to a variety of shark species, many of which have been previously reported as incidental catch in several gillnet fisheries. However, defensible estimates of incidental catch rates are unavailable. This mortality is of concern, given reports of considerable declines in abundance of several large shark species in this area. On the basis of several data sources (incidental catch rates derived using different methods of reporting; fish landings and net days as measures of effort, with fishing trips as sampling units), the total numbers of incidentally caught sharks were estimated in 8 gillnet fisheries for 2001, 2002, and 2003. Confidence intervals were estimated using resampling techniques. Most fisheries reported incidental catch of some sharks, although there were distinct differences between different fisheries in diversity and abundance of species encountered. Spiny dogfish Squalus acanthias was the most commonly captured species, occurring in various fisheries along the south coast of the island of Newfoundland. Large sharks, including basking shark Cetorhinus maximus, shortfin mako Isurus oxyrinchus, porbeagle Lamna nasus, and blue shark Prionace glauca, were reported in small numbers in all fisheries. Deepwater fisheries targeting e.g. Greenland halibut Reinhardtius hippoglossoides caught mainly sharks of the continental slope, such as Greenland shark Somniosus microcephalus, black dogfish Centroscyllium fabricii, and several other deepwater species. Catch rates of several species appear high and may warrant conservation action. For the majority, however, there is insufficient information on abundance, and sometimes even basic biology, to accurately assess the impact of this incidental mortality. © Inter-Research 2010.},

Consequently, sub-lethal effects of capture stress on the reproductive capacity of chondrichthyans are largely unknown. We investigated the reproductive consequences of capture on pregnant southern fiddler rays (Trygonorrhina dumerilii) collected from Swan Bay, Australia, in response to laboratory-simulated trawl capture (8 h) followed immediately by air exposure (30 min). Immediately prior to, and for up to 28 days post trawling, all females were measured for body mass (BM), sex steroid concentrations (17-β estradiol, progesterone, testosterone) and granulocyte to lymphocyte (G:L) ratio. At parturition, neonates were measured for total length (TL), BM and G:L ratio. Trawling reduced maternal BM and elevated the G:L ratio for up to 28 days. Trawling did not significantly affect any sex steroid concentrations relative to controls. Neonates from trawled mothers were significantly lower in BM and TL than control animals, and had an elevated G:L ratio. Our results show that capture of pregnant T. dumerilii can influence their reproductive potential and affect the fitness of neonates. We suggest other viviparous species are likely to be similarly affected. Sub-lethal effects of capture, particularly on reproduction, require further study to improve fisheries management and conservation of chondrichthyans.},

Here we summarize and compare what is known on the biology and conservation of the three largest species of hammerhead sharks: the great hammerhead (Sphyrna mokarran), the scalloped hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini), and the smooth hammerhead (Sphyrna zygaena). We chose these species since they are the most well-studied of the hammerheads, and also because they are commonly captured in target and non-target fisheries worldwide. Thus, we also discuss population trends and the vulnerabilities of each species, and make recommendations for future studies on these fascinating and complex elasmobranch fishes.},

	abstract = {Spatial stock assessments have been developed to address violations of the dynamic pool assumption that the region to be assessed contains a single homogeneous stock. The possibility of such violation is often evident in data that suggest different trends in abundance or catch / survey age- / size-structure among areas that cannot be explained simply by the fishing history among areas. Currently, most stock assessments account for spatial structure using the ‘areas-as-fleets’ approach in which fishery or survey selectivity and catchability are assumed to differ spatially. However, several simulation studies suggest that adopting spatial approaches to stock assessment will improve estimation performance compared to the areas-as-fleets approach or ignoring spatial structure when conducting stock assessments, although at the cost of a larger number of estimable parameters. Spatial approaches to stock assessment and the provision of management advice have been available since the 1950s. However, spatial stock assessments only became adopted for management purposes in the 1990s, with the widespread adoption of the “integrated approach” to stock assessment, which allowed the use of multiple data sets for parameter estimation. The number of spatial stock assessments is now increasing rapidly. This paper outlines some of the key decisions that need to be made when conducting a spatial stock assessment (number of areas, how to model recruitment, movement, growth and dispersal, and model parameterization).},

	abstract = {Determining acceptable rates of human-caused mortality in low-data situations is a concern for many taxa world-wide. An established approach for determining acceptable levels of human-caused mortality of marine mammals and other species of conservation concern is the Potential Biological Removal (PBR) framework, but PBR requires near-unbiased estimates of absolute abundance, constraining its use in systems with limited data. We develop three alternative methods for identifying acceptable levels of human-caused mortality for long-lived, slowly reproducing species, using indices of relative abundance combined with estimates of bycatch mortality in fisheries, and evaluate these methods using simulations similar to those used to develop PBR. Across a variety of scenarios, the parameters of the three methods can be tuned to achieve conservation performance similar to that of PBR in scenarios that represent nearly ideal conditions. However, these methods produce lower and more variable bycatch mortality limits, depend upon reasonably accurate estimates of bycatch mortality and are more sensitive to uncertainties. Synthesis and applications. Here we develop three alternative methods that expand the toolbox of approaches available for use in determining marine mammal conservation reference points for human-caused mortality when it is not possible to apply the more standard, data-hungry PBR approach. These approaches may be useful in supporting the establishment of new bycatch management programmes, or until estimates of absolute abundance become available.},

International agreements such as the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) provide policy frameworks, but assessments and management can be hampered by lack of data and tractable mechanisms to integrate disparate datasets. An assessment of scalloped (Sphyrna lewini) and great (Sphyrna mokarran) hammerhead population structure and connectivity across northern Australia, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea (PNG) was conducted to inform management responses to CMS and Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species listings of these species. An Integrated Assessment Framework (IAF) was devised to systematically incorporate data across jurisdictions and create a regional synopsis, and amalgamated a suite of data from the Australasian region. Scalloped hammerhead populations are segregated by sex and size, with Australian populations dominated by juveniles and small adult males, while Indonesian and PNG populations included large adult females. The IAF process introduced genetic and tagging data to produce conceptual models of stock structure and movement. Several hypotheses were produced to explain stock structure and movement patterns, but more data are needed to identify the most likely hypothesis. This study demonstrates a process for assessing migratory species connectivity and highlights priority areas for hammerhead management and research.},

	abstract = {In principle, the spatial extent of fishery stock assessment should reflect the biological population, and major fishing patterns or population heterogeneity within the area should be represented. However, these theoretical requirements are commonly dismissed in practice, often when there is compelling evidence that spatial scope and structure is mis-specified and without testing if the mis-specified model performs well for informing fishery management. Population dynamics theory, case studies in fishery management as well as simulation tests demonstrate that accurately accounting for spatial structure in stock assessments can improve model performance, and ignoring spatial structure can lead to misperceptions of stock status and failures in fisheries management. Therefore, the development of stock assessment applications should include an evaluation of the most appropriate spatial scope and structure. Some common challenges in defining and modeling spatial structure can be addressed by adopting general best practices, but each species and its fisheries are unique. Accordingly, determining the most appropriate spatial structure involves 1) an interdisciplinary synthesis of all available information to determine the most plausible paradigms of population structure and fishing patterns, 2) the development of spatial operating models that are conditioned on these paradigms, and 3) testing the performance of estimation models and management strategies that are based on the current spatial management unit as well as alternative spatial scopes and structures that reflect population structure and fishing patterns.},

	abstract = {Migratory marine species (MMS) include many of the world's most charismatic organisms such as marine mammals, seabirds, turtles, sharks, and tuna. Many are now among the most threatened due to the diverse range of pressures they encounter during their extensive movements. This paper shows that 21\% of MMS are classified as threatened (i.e. categorized as Critically Endangered, Endangered or Vulnerable). Sea turtles are the most threatened group (85\%), followed by seabirds (27\%), cartilaginous fish (26\%), marine mammals (15\%) and bony fish (11\%). Taken together 48\% of MMS are threatened, Near Threatened or Data Deficient.As well as being threatened they share in common being wide-ranging animals, travelling through the waters of multiple nations as well as in Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (ABNJ) during different times of the year. This makes their conservation a challenge, requiring coordinated action by many nations, international organizations, Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs) and other stakeholders if their populations are to recover to healthy levels and be safeguarded into the future.Even though they are wide-ranging, long-term studies reveal considerable site fidelity and well-defined habitats for many species and areas. These sites are prime candidates for enhanced management such as via Marine Protect Area (MPA) designations. However, existing management frameworks do not yet contribute sufficiently to MMS conservation, MPA networks need to be expanded to capture key areas, in many cases through the application of new dynamic management techniques such as time area closures.Data on the distribution, abundance, behaviours and threats faced by many MMS are now available. These data should be used to inform the design of effective management regimes, such as MPAs, both within and beyond national jurisdictions. MEAs should ensure a full complement of MMS are included within species listings, and encourage further action to safeguard their populations.},

	abstract = {The project has provided management and other stakeholders with information necessary to make informed decisions about the management of four of the key exploited shark species caught in the Queensland inshore net fishery and northern New South Wales line fishery. The project has determined that spatial management of milk sharks within Queensland, and scalloped hammerhead, common black tip and Australian black tip sharks within Queensland and New South Wales is appropriate. The project has determined that both black tip shark species are likely to require co-operative management arrangements between Queensland and New South Wales. For scalloped hammerheads separate stocks between the two jurisdictions were identified from the fisheriesdependent samples, however genetic exchange across borders is likely to be facilitated by movement of adult females and perhaps larger males to a lesser extent. This information will greatly assist compliance with the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (1999) for shark fisheries in north-eastern Australia by providing the necessary basis for robust assessment of the status of stocks of the study species, thereby helping to deliver their sustainable harvest. It also helps to achieve objectives of the Australian National Shark Plan. The project provides the appropriate spatial framework for future monitoring and assessment of the study species. This is at a time when shark fisheries are receiving close attention from all sectors and when monitoring programs are being implemented, aimed at better assessment of stock status. This project has provided the crucial information for developing an appropriate monitoring design as well as the necessary basis for making statements about stock status. The project has addressed research priorities identified by the Queensland Fisheries Research Advisory Board, Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and Queensland Fisheries. Previously management has assumed a single stock for each species on the east coast of Queensland, and management of shark fisheries in New South Wales (NSW) and Queensland has been independent of one another. The project has been able to enhance and develop links between research, management and industry. Strong positive relationships with commercial fishers were crucial in the collection of samples throughout the study area and fisheries managers were part of the project team throughout the study period. During the project the study area was extended to include both Queensland and NSW waters, creating mutualistic and positive links between the States’ research and management agencies. Extension of project results included management representatives from NSW and Queensland, as well as the Northern Territory where similar shark fisheries operate and similar species are targeted. The project was able to provide significant human capital development opportunities providing considerable value to the project outcomes. Use of vertebral microchemistry and life history characteristics as stock determination methods provided material for two PhD students based at James Cook University: Ron Schroeder, vertebral chemistry; and Alastair Harry, life history characteristic. The project has developed novel research methods that have great capacity for future application, including: • Development of a simple and rapid genetic diagnostic tool (RT-HRM-PCR assay) for differentiating among the black tip shark species, for which no simple morphological identifier exists; and • Development of laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) methods for analysing and interpreting microchemical composition of shark vertebrae. The study has provided further confirmation of the effectiveness of using a holistic approach in stock structure studies and justifies investment into such studies.},

The species is now extinct or severely depleted in many former parts of its range and is protected in some other range states where populations persist. The likelihood of collecting substantial new biological information is now low. Here, we review all available life history information on size, age and growth, reproductive biology, and demography as a resource for population assessment and demographic modelling. We also revisit a subset of historical data from the 1970s to examine the maternal size−litter size relationship. All available information on life history is derived from the Indo-West Pacific (i.e. northern Australia) and the Western Atlantic (i.e. Lake Nicaragua-Río San Juan system in Central America) subpopulations. P. pristis reaches a maximum size of at least 705 cm total length (TL), size-at-birth is 72−90 cm TL, female size-at-maturity is reached by 300 cm TL, male size-at-maturity is 280−300 cm TL, age-at-maturity is 8−10 yr, longevity is 30−36 yr, litter size range is 1−20 (mean of 7.3 in Lake Nicaragua), and reproductive periodicity is suspected to be biennial in Lake Nicaragua (Western Atlantic) but annual in Australia (Indo-West Pacific). There was a weak relationship between litter size and maternal size in Lake Nicaragua, and lifetime reproductive output for an individual female from Lake Nicaragua was estimated as 73 pups. Future demographic models should aim to capture the variability and uncertainty in life history parameters for P. pristis and we encourage a conservative approach to any application for conservation and management.},

	abstract = {Recreational fishing is an important wildlife harvesting activity in urban coastal areas, and recreational harvest in these areas can frequently exceed the commercial harvest. Recreational fishing is a key way that many members of the public experience the environment. The activity enhances social capital, promotes respect for nature, provides health benefits and can provide economic benefits to coastal communities. It is also an important driver of the science on aquatic animals and habitats, and an important tangible reason for many members of the public to conserve and protect aquatic resources. Overall, there has been little specific consideration of urban recreational fisheries management in Australia, despite the paramount importance of urban areas as a focus of recreational fishing activity. This paper identifies that in order to maximize individual and societal benefits from recreational fishing, there needs to be a refocussing of management with the aim of being more holistic. Historically, fisheries management in Australia has focused on maximum sustainable yield (MSY) or maximum economic yield (MEY) which is relevant for the commercial fishing sector, but neither of these is directly relevant to recreational fisheries. This paper identifies that Urban Fisheries Management Plans are required that recognize the specific issues associated with urban recreational fisheries. These plans need to coordinate within and between levels of government and have clear management objectives relevant to urban recreational fisheries. Enhanced opportunities for meaningful citizen science can be incorporated at multiple levels within these plans and this can engender public support for environmental stewardship, as well as fill a very important gap in the knowledge base necessary for managing the activity. As urban recreational fisheries are often occurring in highly modified or degraded habitats, a central element of these plans needs to be habitat restoration and this can have broader benefits for aquatic health. Other management tools include habitat creation (e.g., artificial reefs), optimization of coastal infrastructure as fisheries habitat, and stock enhancement. Overall, Urban Fisheries Management Plans represent a necessary evolution of fisheries management to better address the specific challenges of urban recreational fisheries management, and to best ensure that benefits are optimised.},

This research aimed to observe the sustainability of hammerhead shark in Indramayu waters using a bio-economic model of Gordon Schaefer (GS) and Gompertz. The results showed the overfishing of hammerhead shark in Indramayu waters on actual conditions in 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018, both in the GS and Gompertz models. The abundant number of hammerhead sharks started to deplete from 2015 to 2018, and the highest depletion was found in 2017, with a depletion value of 16 tons and depreciation value of IDR 164 million. The depletion rate suffered the most significant decline in 2011 to 2012 for all types of sharks, including hammerhead. The prohibition of consistent fishing and more pronounced law enforcement for hammered shark fishing are needed to maintain the sustainability of this resource.},

In a survey of the four species, Anoxypristis cuspidata was the most abundant and was recorded in both the inshore and offshore set net fisheries. The size distribution and catch locations of A. cuspidata suggest that the inshore area to a depth of 10 m may be the preferred habitat for juveniles of this species, while adults primarily occur offshore. Pristis microdon, P. zijsron and P. clavata were recorded only in the inshore fishery with catches dominated by immature animals. Pristis microdon was caught in the inshore fishery late in the monsoonal wet season (February to April) and inhabited both freshwater and estuarine environments. Pristis zijsron occurred only on the sand and mud flats outside river mouths whilst P. clavata inhabited both the sand and mud flats and upstream estuarine habitats. Observations on reproductive staging and the capture of neonate specimens suggest that in all four pristids, pupping occurred through the wet season until the beginning of the dry season in May.

Nets with a combination of a turtle excluder device and bycatch reduction device reduced the catches of turtles by 99\%, seasnakes by 5\%, sharks by 17.7\%, rays by 36.3\%, large sponges by 85.3\%, and small bycatch by 8\%, however, these results were largely attributable to the influence of the turtle excluder devices. Nets with both devices also reduced the catch of commercially important prawns by 6\%, but the proportion of soft and damaged prawns was reduced by 41\%. The combination of these devices had no measurable impact on catches of any of the three byproduct species groups: Thenus spp. (Moreton Bay bugs), Teuthoidea spp. (squid) and Amusium pleuronectes (scallops). Turtles excluder devices reduced the numbers of larger sharks and rays ({\textgreater}1 m) by 86\% and 94\%, respectively. They did not reduce the total number of sawfish caught, but did reduce the number of the most commonly caught species - the narrow sawfish (Anoxypristis cuspidata) - by 73.3\%. Upward- and downward-excluding turtle excluder devices performed about equally for most species groups, although upward excluders were more effective for sharks and less effective for large sponges. The performance of BRDs was poor for most groups and could be improved by using them in more effective positions such as closer to the codend catch. The use of these devices is a major step towards ensuring the long-term conservation of many species, especially endangered sea turtles and vulnerable elasmobranchs. As fishers become more experienced in their use, we are optimistic that the fishery's impact on bycatch will reduce even further. Crown Copyright © 2006.},

	volume = {100},
	issn = {00900656},
	abstract = {The bycatch of Australia's northern prawn fishery (NPF) comprises 56 elasmobranch species (16 families). The impact of this fishery on the sustainability of these species has not been addressed. We obtained estimates of catch rates and the within-net survival of elasmobranchs. Carcharhinus tilstoni, C. dussumieri, Rhynchobatus djiddensis, and Himantura toshi represented 65\% of the bycatch. For most species, {\textgreater}50\% of individuals in the bycatch were immature, and some species recruited to the fishery at birth. For all species combined, 66\% of individuals in the bycatch died in the trawl net. The relative sustainability of elasmobranchs caught as bycatch was examined by ranking species with respect to their susceptibility to capture and mortality due to prawn trawling and with respect to their capacity to recover once the population was depleted. The species that were least likely to be sustainable were four species of pristids, Dasyatis brevicaudata, and Himantura jenkinsii. These are bottom-associated batoids that feed on benthic organisms and are highly susceptible to capture in prawn trawls. The recovery capacity of these species was also low according to our criteria. Our results provide a valuable first step towards ensuring the sustainability of elasmobranchs that are caught as bycatch by highlighting species for management and research. The effectiveness of turtle excluder devices (TEDs) in reducing elasmobranch bycatch varied greatly among species but was generally not very effective because most of the captured species were small.},

	doi = {10.1111/1365-2664.13654},
	abstract = {Large, remote marine protected areas (MPAs) containing both reef and pelagic habitats, have been shown to offer considerable refuge to populations of reef-associated sharks. Many large MPAs are, however, impacted by illegal fishing activity conducted by unlicensed vessels. While enforcement of these reserves is often expensive, it would likely benefit from the integration of ecological data on the mobile animals they are designed to protect. Consequently, shark populations in some protected areas continue to decline, as they remain a prime target for illegal fishers. To understand shark movements and their vulnerability to illegal fishing, 3 years of acoustic tracking data, from 101 reef-associated sharks, were analysed as movement networks to explore the predictability of movement patterns and identify key movement corridors within the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) MPA. We examined how space use and connectivity overlap with spatially explicit risk of illegal fishing, through data obtained from the management consultancy enforcing the MPA. Using individual-based models, the movement networks of two sympatric shark species were efficiently predicted with distance-decay functions ({\textgreater}95\% movements accurately predicted). Model outliers were used to highlight the locations with unexpectedly high movement rates where MPA enforcement patrols might most efficiently mitigate predator removal. Activity space estimates and network metrics illustrate that silvertip sharks were more dynamic, less resident and link larger components of the MPA than grey reef sharks. However, we show that this behaviour potentially enhances their exposure to illegal fishing activity. Synthesis and applications. Marine protected area (MPA) enforcement strategies are often limited by resources. The British Indian Ocean Territory MPA, one of the world's largest ‘no take’ MPAs, has a single patrol vessel to enforce 640,000 km2 of open ocean, atoll and reef ecosystems. We argue that to optimize the patrol vessel search strategy and thus enhance their protective capacity, ecological data on the space use and movements of desirable species, such as large-bodied reef predators, must be incorporated into management plans. Here, we use electronic tracking data to evaluate how shark movement dynamics influence species mortality trajectories in exploited reef ecosystems. In doing so we discuss how network analyses of such data might be applied for protected area enforcement.},

	abstract = {Understanding migration dynamics of fishes that aggregate-spawn is critical if spatiotemporal closures to fishing are expected to protect them. Concern over fishing of Chrysophrys auratus spawning aggregations in embayments near a west Australian city led to an annual 4-month spatial fishing closure. However, the extent to which it protects fish migrating to and from aggregations is unclear. Acoustic telemetry demonstrated a bimodal pattern of entry to and departure from the main embayment via only one of several pathways. Among years, 33\%–56\% of fish occurred in the pathway prior to the closure, but most left before it ceased. Fish were detected within the closure in multiple but not always consecutive years. Variation in migration timing and aggregation philopatry may alter capture risk, but pre-and postspawning migratory fish are fished in the main pathway and adjacent reefs, which would presumably impact spawning aggregation biomass. Assessment of this would assist in understanding whether expansion of the closure’s spatial and temporal limits is necessary to ensure spawning biomass or whether current management is sufficient.},

Here, we used a Dynamic Bioclimate Envelope Model to project range shift of exploited marine fishes and invertebrates in Western Australia. We combined published data and expert knowledge to predict current species distributions for 30 tropical, sub-tropical and temperate species that occur along the coast of Western Australia. Using outputs from both a Regional Oceanographic Model and a Global Circulation Model, we simulated change in the distribution of each species. Our study shows that under the SRES (Special Report for Emission Scenarios) A1B scenario, the median rate of distribution shift is around 19km decade-1 towards higher latitudes and 9m deeper decade-1-1 by 2055 relative to 2005. As a result, species gains and losses are expected along the south coast and north coast of Western Australia, respectively. Also, the coast of Western Australia is expected to experience a 'tropicalisation' of the marine community in the future, with increasing dominance of warmer-water species. Such changes in species assemblages may have large ecological and socio-economic implications through shifts in fishing grounds and unexpected trophic effects. © 2012 CSIRO.},

The demography of two species of sawfish that occur in the western Atlantic - Pristis pectinata and P. perotteti - was investigated using age-structured life tables. Life history parameters for use in the life tables were obtained from published data. Five scenarios were tested for P. pectinata to incorporate uncertainties about life history data. Values of intrinsic rate of increase ranged from 0.08 to 0.13 yr-1, and population doubling times from 5.4 to 8.5 yrs. Eight scenarios were tested for P perotteti. The most likely range for the intrinsic rate of increase was 0.05-0.07 yr-1, with population doubling times of 10.3-13.5 yrs. Four scenarios investigating the sensitivity to methods of estimating natural mortality produced similar results. The demographic results were sensitive to changes in reproductive periodicity and natural mortality. The results indicate that if effective conservation plans can be implemented for sawfish and sawfish habitats, recovery to levels where there is little risk of extinction will take at least several decades.},

According to the von Bertalanffy growth model, the results indicated that the species showed from three to seven cohorts annually and slow growth (Wi = 57.20\%): L∞ = 292.86 cm, K = 0.141 per year and t0 = −2.26. Length of sexual maturity was 239.30 and 209.10 cm at first capture; the average natural mortality value was 0.231 per year, by fishing 0.051 per year with a total mortality of 0.26 1 per year and exploitation rate of 0.15. Interannual variability was recorded in biomass with an average of 7367.24 tonnes, as well as a spatial permanence pattern. The results suggest that the La Niña event biologically favours the population in the area.

Additionally, a length-based Bayesian model was applied to fishery-independent length-frequency data, and a full Bayesian model was fitted to length-at-age data to estimate parameters for von Bertalanffy growth equation. Both the length-based and full Bayesian models failed to converge; the length-frequency data showed high bimodality unrelated to season, year, or other factors, and band counts were not predictable by length.

The theory uses age as the structuring variable; however, there are several reasons to use body size as the structuring variable. Most of the processes that affect a fish are determined by its body size rather than its age: Consumption, mortality, maturation, fecundity, fish gear selectivity, etc., and measurements of body size are easy, accurate, and abundant. Here, I review size-based theory of a fish stock and compare it to classic age-based theory. I show that size- and age-based demography are equivalent representations of demography. However, size-based theory is axiomatic, which leads to a deeper theory with two advantages: Predictions need fewer parameters than age-based theory and the theory connects directly to life-history traits. The connection with traits makes size-based theory particularly useful for data-poor application and facilitates evolutionary calculations. I compare age- and size-based theories for fisheries impact and stock assessments and provide a perspective on the challenges and future of single-stock theory.},

	abstract = {In the waters of southeast Australia, two species of sawshark—the common (Pristiophorus cirratus) and southern (Pristiophorus nudipinnis) sawshark—are frequent by-catch in commercial fisheries. While harvesting of both species is currently considered sustainable, there has been no investigation of whether P. cirratus and P. nudipinnis display genetically distinct populations throughout their ranges. Such information is necessary for effective management of these species in commercial fisheries. This study examined population structure in both sawshark species through analysis of two mitochondrial genes: cytochrome b (Cyt-b) and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 (ND5). Results indicated contrasting levels of population structure, with P. cirratus consisting of two, possibly three, genetically distinct populations with two mitochondrial lineages and P. nudipinnis consisting of a single population. Tests for population expansion also highlighted differences between the two species. Population expansion was detected for the entire P. nudipinnis population, whereas this was only the case for one mitochondrial lineage in P. cirratus. The entire P. cirratus population displayed signals of demographic stability. It is hypothesised that the opening and closing of Bass Strait during glacial-interglacial cycles played a major role in shaping the population structure and expansion signatures observed in this study. Mitochondrial data also suggest that patterned and uniform brown P. cirratus are the same species. Fisheries managers should consider adopting two management units in southern Australia—one along the east coast (for the eastern P. cirratus population) and one along the south coast (for the southern P. cirratus population and the single P. nudipinnis population).},

Despite improvement in the methods applied to CPUE standardization, for many datasets model diagnostics can still indicate poor conformity to modeling assumptions, imprecision and unexplained fishing behaviors. In this study we examine catch rate data of an Irish mid-water pair trawl fleet targeting albacore tuna (Thunnus alalunga) in the North East Atlantic. A fleet strategy of searching and congregating on fish aggregations combined with negative skew in model residuals suggest that multiple components exist within the dataset. Assuming up to five components, finite mixture models are applied and compared using the Bayesian information criterion. The two component model most consistently explained observed distributions in fishing behaviors and catch rates. Finite mixture modeling markedly improved conformity to modeling assumptions, resulting in substantial improvement in the precision of specific components used in CPUE standardization and reduced inter-annual variability of the catch rate trend. These methods may facilitate investigations of technological creep but also raise questions on how best to use the results in assessment. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

To illustrate our approach, we provide examples of the process to assess four circumglobal sharks with differing temporal and spatial data-deficiency: Blue Shark (Prionace glauca), Shortfin Mako (Isurus oxyrinchus), Dusky Shark (Carcharhinus obscurus), and Great Hammerhead (Sphyrna mokarran). For each species, the BSSM provided global population change estimates over three generation lengths bounded by uncertainty levels in intuitive outputs, enabling informed decisions on the status of each species. Integrating similar analyses into future workshops would help conservation practitioners ensure robust, consistent, and transparent Red List assessments for other long-lived, wide-ranging species.},

	abstract = {Electronic monitoring (EM) has the capacity to collect fisheries-dependent data to support fisheries management decision-making. Following successful pilot studies, EM was introduced into several Australian Commonwealth fisheries in 2015, including the Eastern Tuna and Billfish Fishery (ETBF) and the Gillnet, Hook and Trap (GHAT) sector of the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF). We compared two years of EM analyst and fisher-reported logbook data from the ETBF and GHAT sector to examine the level of congruence in reporting of both retained and discarded catch and protected species interactions. In general, congruence between EM analyst and fisher-reported logbook data in both the ETBF and GHAT sector was higher for retained than for discarded catch, and the ETBF had a higher level of data equivalency than the GHAT sector. Fishery-wide estimates of congruence, however, concealed a large amount of variation among individual and groups of species. EM analyst and fisher-reported logbook data were highly congruent for some species (e.g. tunas, swordfish and gummy shark), but for others there were clear taxonomic (e.g. escolar and rudderfish), identification (e.g. sharks, marlins) and reporting (e.g. draughtboard shark and elephantfish) issues, which reduced overall congruence. There was evidence of increased congruence through time, particularly for discarded bycatch species in the GHAT sector, due presumably to increased manager feedback and communication with fishers on their logbook reporting. While EM analyst and fisher-reported logbook interactions with protected species in the GHAT sector were equivalent, this was not the case for species other than seabirds in the ETBF. In the ETBF, a greater number of interactions were reported by fishers in their logbooks, suggesting a need to modify existing or install additional EM technology to improve on-board vision for the EM analyst. It is important to review the performance of any integrated EM system through time to ensure it is fulfilling the data requirements for the fishery and meeting the overall objectives of the program.},

Derived models of species environmental niches indicated that shark fishing effort is concentrated within Exclusive Economic Zones, mostly in coastal Australia, Indonesia, the United States, Brazil, Mexico and Japan. By coupling two distinct tools, barcoding and niche modelling, our results provide new insights for monitoring and enforcement.

Fishery-dependent bycatch records from 2009/2010 to 2017/2018 showed a strong peak in the mortality rate per fishing trip during March and April, closely associated with the final stage of chick rearing. Observers during those peak months in 2007, 2008, 2017, and 2018 recorded 171 mortalities during 222 trips at per trip rates (±95\% confidence limits) ranging from 0.59 (0.25-1.17) in 2017 to 1.10 (0.56-1.96) in 2007. Zero mortalities were recorded on at least 70\% of trips in any year, suggesting infrequent formation of net folds that can trap birds. Total annual mortalities estimated for 2016/2017 and 2017/2018 were 123 (52-251) and 172 (91-302), respectively. Although within a sustainable anthropogenic limit of 495 (369-660) estimated from conservative application of the potential biological removal method, the extent of other anthropogenic mortalities is unknown.

In addition, the widely accepted notion that immediate post-release active swimming is an indicator of shark condition has never been tested. This study assessed the effects of deck exposure by analysing post-release behaviour of two species of shark, the draughtboard (Cephaloscyllium laticeps) and the piked spurdog (Squalus megalops) in-situ using a remote-operated-vehicle and in a replicated experiment in controlled conditions. In total, 67 sharks were caught with demersal fish trawls and commercial longlines and subjected to different deck exposures and release environments. Tailbeat rates of deck-exposed sharks were significantly lower than the control sharks, but this effect differed between in-situ and experimental environments. Results indicate that capture has species-specific effects, that post-release effects may last longer than 5 min, and that controlled experiments may not be reliable indicators of post-release effects. Immediate post-release swimming was not a good predictor of post-release behaviour, suggesting capture and release fisheries may have significant sub-lethal effects on some species of shark, and that limiting capture or handling time may reduce post-release effects.},

	abstract = {We describe a first estimate of the potential to increase production from Australia's commercial fisheries based on the difference between current catches and maximum sustainable yield (MSY). MSY is not being advocated as a target reference point but enables a level of consistency across species and/or jurisdictions with different reference points. MSY estimates were obtained for 290 species/stocks that comprised 84\% of annual landings. 75\% of the estimates were computed using methods applied specifically for this study, aided by an assessment framework, and supporting software. The catch-MSY method was used extensively given the lack of formal assessments for many species, and the limitations of taking this approach are discussed. The results indicated that potential production could be more than double the current national catch (an increase over current catches of about 124\%), but potential increases varied considerably among Federal, State and Territory jurisdictions. The potential for increased production was particularly influenced by predictions for highly productive small pelagic fishes, although ignoring the potential for increased catches of these species still led to an estimate of an increase of almost 80\% over current catches. Other factors such as whether an increase in production has market demand are also clearly important, along with other social and economic issues. Impacts on ecosystem sustainability and the consequences of climate change were beyond the scope of this study and would need to be considered in separate analyses. However, in making our estimates of potential production we acknowledged the issues with attempting to use single species approaches to provide fish community wide estimates and acted conservatively with our interpretation. Consequently, the results presented in this paper provide useful insights into possible biologically sustainable catches and the potential for increased production.},

	abstract = {The promotion of crude shark cartilage extracts as a cure for cancer has contributed to at least two significant negative outcomes: a dramatic decline in shark populations and a diversion of patients from effective cancer treatments. An alleged lack of cancer in sharks constitutes a key justification for its use. Herein, both malignant and benign neoplasms of sharks and their relatives are described, including previously unreported cases from the Registry of Tumors in Lower Animals, and two sharks with two cancers each. Additional justifications for using shark cartilage are illogical extensions of the finding of antiangiogenic and anti-invasive substances in cartilage. Scientific evidence to date supports neither the efficacy of crude cartilage extracts nor the ability of effective components to reach and eradicate cancer cells. The fact that people think shark cartilage consumption can cure cancer illustrates the serious potential impacts of pseudoscience. Although components of shark cartilage may work as a cancer retardant, crude extracts are ineffective. Efficiencies of technology (e.g., fish harvesting), the power of mass media to reach the lay public, and the susceptibility of the public to pseudoscience amplifies the negative impacts of shark cartilage use. To facilitate the use of reason as the basis of public and private decision-making, the evidence-based mechanisms of evaluation used daily by the scientific community should be added to the training of media and governmental professionals. Increased use of logical, collaborative discussion will be necessary to ensure a sustainable future for man and the biosphere.},

	title = {{GHATF} shark survey of population abundance and population size composition for taget, byproduct and bycatch species},
	abstract = {An industry-based fishery-independent fixed-site survey using 4–8 inch mesh size gillnets was designed and carried out to survey the species caught in the Gillnet Hook and Trap Fishery with a particular focus on school shark and to a lesser extent, gummy shark. The main value of this survey is to establish the starting point of an independent time-series of catch rates for the main species caught in the fishery. The design provides for comprehensive baseline data for comparison with future surveys. Future comparisons will be possible for target, byproduct and main bycatch species. The three objectives of the project were met completely.  The conduct of and quality of data from the 2007–08 survey completed under research quota demonstrates that it is feasible to adopt a fishery-independent fixed-site survey undertaken on commercial fishing vessels to provide most of the required monitoring data for the shark fishery. The five adopted mesh-sizes for the survey fleet of gillnets provide data far superior to those that can be obtained by scientific observers on commercial fishing vessels using 6- or 6½-inch mesh-size or obtained from port sampling. Not only is it expected that catch rates from the present and any future surveys will provide indices of abundance more robust than fishers’ logbook data as used for assessment in the past, the survey data provide direct measures of recruitment from the small mesh sizes and of surviving breeding stock from the large mesh-sizes  For the 2007–08 survey, the catch comprised mostly chondrichthyes followed by teleosts; cephalopods, gastropods, bivalves, crinoids, crustaceans, seabirds, marine mammals, and echinoderms were caught in low numbers. For chondrichthyans, gummy shark, spikey spurdog and school shark accounted for more than three quarters of the chondrichthyan catch (in number). For teleosts, jackass morwong, blue warehou and bight redfish accounted for almost half of the teleost catch (in number). There was a decline in the overall catch rate of chondrichthyan and teleost species with increased mesh size. There was a significant effect of mesh size for many species; these species showed a pattern of a highest catch (mode) for a particular mesh size. Post-hoc analyses comparing information from the 2007–08 survey with the earlier surveys of 1973–76, 1986–87, and 1998–01 indicate that there are insufficient overlapping fishing sites among the four survey periods to provide statistically robust comparisons although for some species in specific regions and zones there were significant differences in catch rate.  The number of discarded individuals and species in the 2007–08 survey decreased with mesh size. The most commonly discarded species (spikey spurdog, draughtboard shark and port jackson shark) have a very low post-capture mortality probability. Three types of wildlife interactions were recorded with ‘wildlife diving and feeding on discards’ being the most common interaction.  Apart from the smallest size classes, all size classes of gummy shark were well represented in survey catches. Small size classes of school shark, common sawshark, southern sawshark, and elephant fish were under-represented at the sampling sites of the survey. Applying available length-frequency and age-frequency composition data from the survey, total mortality estimates could be made for each of male and female gummy shark, but not for school shark.},

Computer-intensive techniques, initially developed in the 1970s, can now be used to incorporate all these sources of uncertainty into a rigorous statistical framework. Risk assessment combined with decision analysis provides a methodology for quantifying these uncertainties and a framework for making management decisions in an uncertain world. In the last decade they have been applied widely in economics, epidemiology and fisheries management. Their potential use in conservation biology is reviewed here using two examples: population viability analysis and the reduction of the by-catch of small cetaceans in fishing gear.

	abstract = {Selectivity in fish is often size-dependent, which results in differential fishing mortality rates across fish of the same age, an effect known as "Lee’s Phenomenon". We extend previous work on using length composition to estimate the spawning potential ratio (SPR) for data-limited stocks by developing a computationally efficient length-structured per-recruit model that splits the population into a number of subcohorts, or growth-type-groups, to account for size-dependent fishing mortality rates. Two simple recursive equations, using the life history ratio of the natural mortality rate to the von Bertalanffy growth parameter (M/K), were developed to generate length composition data, reducing the complexity of the previous approach. Using simulated and empirical data, we demonstrate that ignoring Lee’s Phenomenon results in overestimates of fishing mortality and negatively biased estimates of SPR. We also explored the behaviour of the model under various scenarios, including alternative life history strategies and the presence of size-dependent natural mortality. The model developed in this paper may be a useful tool to estimate the SPR for data-limited stock where it is not possible to apply more conventional methods.},

Two of the most recent models that are especially promising are (i) CMSY+, the latest refined version of CMSY that has progressed from Catch-MSY, and (ii) SRA+ (Stock Reduction Analysis Plus) a recent developments in field. Comparing COMs and evaluating their relative performance is essential for determining the state of regional and global fisheries that may be lacking necessary data that would be required to run traditional assessment models. In this paper we interrogate how performance of COMs can be improved by incorporating additional sources of information. We evaluate the performance of COMs on a dataset of 48 data-rich ICES (International Council for the Exploration of Seas) stock assessments. As one measure of performance, we consider the ability of the model to correctly classify stock status using FAO’s 3-tier classification that is also used for reporting on sustainable development goals to the UN. Both COMs showed notable bias when run with their inbuilt default heuristics, but as the quality of prior information increased, classification rates for the terminal year improved substantially. We conclude that although further COM refinements show some potential, most promising is the ongoing research into developing biomass or fishing effort priors for COMs in order to be able to reliably track stock status for the majority of the world’s fisheries currently lacking stock assessments.},

JABBA can be used for biomass dynamic stock assessment applications, and has emerged from the development of a Bayesian State-Space Surplus Production Model framework, already applied in stock assessments of sharks, tuna, and billfishes around the world. JABBA presents a unifying, flexible framework for biomass dynamic modelling, runs quickly, and generates reproducible stock status estimates and diagnostic tools. Specific emphasis has been placed on flexibility for specifying alternative scenarios, achieving high stability and improved convergence rates. Default JABBA features include: 1) an integrated state-space tool for averaging and automatically fitting multiple catch per unit effort (CPUE) time series; 2) data-weighting through estimation of additional observation variance for individual or grouped CPUE; 3) selection of Fox, Schaefer, or Pella-Tomlinson production functions; 4) options to fix or estimate process and observation variance components; 5) model diagnostic tools; 6) future projections for alternative catch regimes; and 7) a suite of inbuilt graphics illustrating model fit diagnostics and stock status results. As a case study, JABBA is applied to the 2017 assessment input data for South Atlantic swordfish (Xiphias gladius). We envision that JABBA will become a widely used, open-source stock assessment tool, readily improved and modified by the global scientific community.},

Ninety-five specimens of M. goodei (24 males and 71 females) and 175 M. ridens (24 males and 151 females) were sampled. Female M. goodei attained disc-width-at-50\% maturity (WD50) at 683 mm. Uterine fecundity was four to five embryos. The largest male recorded, a mature individual, had a disc width of 650 mm. In M. ridens, WD50 was 662 mm. Uterine fecundity varied from one to eight embryos. The largest male on record was a maturing 590 mm WD individual. The hepato-somatic index was higher in autumn in females of M. goodei, and in the summer in M. ridens. The gonado-somatic index and the largest vitellogenic follicle diameter were higher in spring in both species. Pregnant females of both species were recorded during spring, although for M. ridens, these females also occurred in summer. Embryos had WD of 61–218 and 40–236 mm for M. goodei and M. ridens, respectively. The incidence of pregnant females in southern Brazil in spring–summer coincides with the small-scale beach artisanal fisheries season peak, when M. goodei and M. ridens suffer fishing mortality, while using the coastal shallow areas in the warmer periods (spring–summer) to give birth.},

We review 11 COMs, comparing performance through application to data-rich stocks and simulated fisheries. The catch-only methods evaluated here produce imprecise and biased estimates of B/BMSY, especially for stocks that are lightly exploited. They were also generally poor classifiers of stock status. While no method performed best across all stocks, ensembles of multiple COMs generally performed better than individual COMs. We advocate for testing new COMs using this common platform. We also caution that performance in estimating stock status is not sufficient for gauging the usefulness of COMs in managing fisheries. Greater use of management strategy evaluation is needed before COMs can be considered a reliable tool for management.},

Special emphasis was given to derive informative priors for productivity, unexploited stock size, catchability and biomass from population dynamics theory. Both models gave good predictions of the maximum intrinsic rate of population increase r, unexploited stock size k and maximum sustainable yield MSY when validated against simulated data with known parameter values. CMSY provided, in addition, reasonable predictions of relative biomass and exploitation rate. Both models were evaluated against 128 real stocks, where estimates of biomass were available from full stock assessments. BSM estimates of r, k and MSY were used as benchmarks for the respective CMSY estimates and were not significantly different in 76\% of the stocks. A similar test against 28 data-limited stocks, where CPUE instead of biomass was available, showed that BSM and CMSY estimates of r, k and MSY were not significantly different in 89\% of the stocks.

	abstract = {An increasing number of studies have been examining the functional configuration of biological communities or ecosystems using biological traits. Here, we investigated the temporal dynamics and resilience of the traits composition in Mediterranean fisheries landings over 31 years (1985–2015). We transcribed the FAO Mediterranean landings dataset for 101 marine species into a dataset of 23 traits related to the life cycle, distribution, ecology and behaviour. Mediterranean mean Sea Surface Temperature (SST) was evaluated as a potential driver of the traits composition. Trait dynamics were evaluated both individually and holistically by developing an Integrated Traits Resilience Assessment (ITRA). ITRA is a variation of the Integrated Resilience Assessment (IRA), a method to infer resilience dynamics and build stability landscapes of complex natural systems. Changes in landings trait dynamics were documented both for individual traits and for the entire traits ‘system’, and a relevant regime shift was detected in the second half of the 1990s. The traits system switched to higher optimal temperature, more summer spawning, shorter life span, smaller maximum size, shallower optimal depth and planktivorous diet. This shift was found to be a lagged discontinuous response to sea warming, which gradually eroded the resilience of the original state of the traits system, leading it into a new basin of attraction. The inclusion of ecological/response traits (related to environmental preferences) in our analyses indicates potential mechanisms that explain the observed shift, while changes in functional/effect traits indicate potential impacts on ecosystem functioning. Our findings suggest that changes in the Mediterranean ecosystems are evidently larger than previously thought, with profound implications for the management of this highly impacted sea. ​.},

Although there are growing concerns about this largely unregulated and unmonitored trade, little information still exists about its dynamics, the species involved and the impact of this pressure on stocks in various regions. Our study provides the first attempt at characterizing the trade in shark products from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the fourth largest exporter in the world of raw dried shark fins to Hong Kong. A review of trade records and informal interviews with local traders confirmed that the UAE is being used as hub in the broader North Indian Ocean region for the trade in shark products with the Emirati fishery minimally contributing to this trade. Results based on morphological identification of sharks (n= 12,069) and DNA barcoding of tissue samples (n= 655) indicated that the trade was made up of at least 37 species. The most abundant families represented at the Dubai study site were the Sphyrnidae (9.3\%), Lamnidae (9\%) and Alopiidae (5.9\%). While information was mostly limited to shark products originating from the UAE and Oman, results indicated that 45.3\% of species traded were considered to be at high risk of global extinction based on the IUCN Red List Global Assessments. Since many of the species found during this survey are likely part of stocks shared with other countries, regional cooperation and management will be crucial to ensure their long term survival.},

	abstract = {The shark fin trade is a major driver of shark exploitation in fisheries all over the world, most of which are not managed on a species-specific basis. Species-specific trade information highlights taxa of particular concern and can be used to assess the efficacy of management measures and anticipate emerging threats. The species composition of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, one of the world's largest fin trading hubs, was partially assessed in 1999–2001. We randomly selected and genetically identified fin trimmings (n = 4800), produced during fin processing, from the retail market of Hong Kong in 2014–2015 to assess contemporary species composition of the fin trade. We used nonparametric species estimators to determine that at least 76 species of sharks, batoids, and chimaeras supplied the fin trade and a Bayesian model to determine their relative proportion in the market. The diversity of traded species suggests species substitution could mask depletion of vulnerable species; one-third of identified species are threatened with extinction. The Bayesian model suggested that 8 species each comprised {\textgreater}1\% of the fin trimmings (34.1–64.2\% for blue [Prionace glauca], 0.2–1.2\% for bull [Carcharhinus leucas] and shortfin mako [Isurus oxyrinchus]); thus, trade was skewed to a few globally distributed species. Several other coastal sharks, batoids, and chimaeras are in the trade but poorly managed. Fewer than 10 of the species we modeled have sustainably managed fisheries anywhere in their range, and the most common species in trade, the blue shark, was not among them. Our study and approach serve as a baseline to track changes in composition of species in the fin trade over time to better understand patterns of exploitation and assess the effects of emerging management actions for these animals.},

Understanding biological and ecological characteristics of sharks is essential to effectively implement management measures, but to fully understand drivers of fishing pressure social factors must be considered through multidisciplinary and integrated approaches. The present study aimed to use fisher and trader knowledge to describe the shark catch and product supply chain in Northeastern Brazil, and evaluate perceptions regarding the regional conservation status of shark species. Non-systematic observations and structured individual interviews were conducted with experienced fishers and traders. The demand and economic value of shark fins has reportedly decreased over the last 10 years while the shark meat trade has increased slightly, including a small increase in the average price per kilogram of meat. Several threatened shark species were reportedly often captured off shore and traded at local markets. This reported and observed harvest breaches current Brazilian environmental laws. Fishing communities are aware of population declines of several shark species, but rarely take action to avoid capture of sharks. The continuing capture of sharks is mainly due to a lack of knowledge of environmental laws, lack of enforcement by responsible authorities, and difficulties encountered by fishers in finding alternative income streams. National and regional conservation measures are immediately required to reduce overfishing on shark populations in Northeastern Brazil. Social and economic improvements for poor fishing communities must also be implemented to achieve sustainable fisheries.},

Although fishing effort distribution and marine habitat distribution and use are increasingly well understood, little research has quantified spatio-temporal changes in fishing effort or investigated drivers of these changes. Here, a holistic approach was taken to investigate socio-economic, environmental and technological drivers of change in fishing effort distribution of the Northumberland pot-fishery (2004–2014) using Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) analyses. BBNs were populated using large-scale high resolution spatial and temporal fisheries monitoring data, quantitative and qualitative interviews with fishers and expert opinion. Increases in fishing effort over time were explained by a combination of changes in fleet composition and fishers’ behaviour. Increasing vessel and engine sizes, combined with an increased uptake of improved fishing technology have resulted in a greater ability for vessels to fish a greater number of pots. This increase in vessel and fishing capability has resulted in fishers’ increased ability to fish in harsher weather conditions, as well as target specific areas or habitats quickly and opportunistically. Non-technological factors, such as declines in stocks of finfish and nephrops and the increasing operational costs of participating in these fisheries may have resulted in fishers solely fishing in the less regulated pot-fishery, targeting high value European lobster on a full-time basis. Increasing costs of pot-fishing in Northumberland coupled with stagnating crab and lobster landings prices may have resulted in increased fishing effort to maintain profitability.},

	abstract = {Fishers’ economic status is hard to assess because fisheries socio-economic data, including earnings, are often not centrally available, standardized or accessible in a form that allows scaled-up or comparative analyses. The lack of fishing income data impedes sound management and allows biased perceptions about fishers’ status to persist. We compile data from intergovernmental and regional data sets, as well as case-studies, on income earned from marine wild-capture fisheries. We explore the level and distribution of fishers’ income across fisheries sectors and geographical regions, and highlight challenges in data collection and reporting. We find that fishers generally are not the poorest of the poor based on average fishing income from 89 countries, but income levels vary widely. Fishing income in the large-scale sector is higher than the small-scale sector by about 2.2 times, and in high-income versus low-income countries by almost 9 times. Boat owners and captains earned more than double that of crew and owner-operators, while income from fisheries is greater than that from agricultural work in 63\% of countries in this study. Nonetheless, incomes are below national poverty lines in 34\% of the countries with data. More detailed fishing income statistics is needed for quantitative scientific research and for supporting socio-economic policies. Key gaps to address include the lack of a centralized database for fisheries income statistics and the coarse resolution at which economic statistics are reported internationally. A first step to close the gap is to integrate socio-economic monitoring and reporting in fisheries management.},

Debate exists on whether shark conservation and management are effectively addressed with tightened trade controls for imported shark products or blanket bans that outright end U.S. participation in the shark fin trade. Here we contribute to this debate with a review and analysis of economic, nutritional, ethical, and legal arguments, as well as of the shark fisheries status and shark fin trade. We show that the United States has a limited commercial interest in shark fisheries and contributes to the shark fin trade mainly as a facilitator. A fin trade ban has few tangible economic drawbacks but would have a considerable conservation impact. While making all shark fisheries sustainable is the ultimate goal, in practice this objective is far from achievable everywhere in the world. Conversely, banning shark fin trade is an interim measure that nations like the United States can take with negligible cost and can truly impact the biggest driver of shark exploitation globally.},

	abstract = {Restructuring rural communities can be seen as natural population level experiments of great social epidemiological interest. Following the extensive decline in small-scale fishing in the later decades of the 20th century, many coastal communities have undergone considerable societal restructuring. In Norway, this has entailed a substantial reduction of the fishing workforce, concurrent with new employment opportunities in public sector and aquaculture. The former socialization into fishing from a young age is greatly reduced, with coastal youths now facing other life courses than preceding generations. As restructuring of societies is found to be intertwined with public health, coastal communities can provide valuable insights on public health during times of transitions. In this study, we use repeated cross-sectional population health data from rural Norwegian municipalities to assess the development of self-rated health over four decades in a coastal population who has undergone restructuring of local labour markets. We assess generational differences in health by comparing the prevalence of poor self-rated health at three ages reflecting three generations at each cross section: youths, adults and elderly. We compare results to adjacent geographical areas to assess geographical differences in self-rated health over time. We found a higher predicted prevalence of poor self-rated health in rural coastal adults and elderly compared to other geographical areas across all decades. However, trends revealed improving self-rated health in rural coastal adults and elderly, as well as narrowing health gaps between the rural coastal population and the remaining geographical areas in this Norwegian setting. Our results shed light on public health development in restructuring coastal communities.},

	abstract = {In fisheries management, decisions regarding access (which users can fish) and allocation (what share of the resource they can use) often raise issues of justice, fairness and equity. In Australia, ecologically sustainable development (ESD) has been prioritised in fisheries legislation, policy, and management. However, the desired optimal community outcomes arising from determination of access and allocation are difficult to ascertain as few metrics of economic or social benefits are available. Here, we interviewed fishery managers and other prominent stakeholders responsible for advising Australian state, territory, and Commonwealth governments on access and allocation. This information was augmented with reviews of available information and case study analyses. Whereas access and allocation are highly constrained for commercial fishers, this is much less so for recreational and Indigenous fishers. Relatively high participation rates for recreational fishers command high implicit social value reflected in political power and commercial fishing is prohibited near major population centres in most Australian jurisdictions. Some jurisdictions, such as South and Western Australia, have explicit access and allocation policies, with shares of popular species such as rock lobster, abalone, and snapper allocated to the recreational and Indigenous sectors. Allocations to the commercial sector and, when applicable to the recreational sector, generally reflect estimates of their catch history rather than an evaluation of optimal benefits. Furthermore, allocation among jurisdictions is inconsistent and seemingly reflective of political rather than economic decision making. Strategic intent exists in many jurisdictions to incorporate social value into allocation decision making. However, few social metrics exist in management plans and these factors are rarely considered in formal access and allocation decisions. Thus, determining the best use of fisheries resources remains elusive in Australia and the utility of ESD and its application to sustainable fishery management and optimal community benefit remains unresolved.},

	abstract = {Globally, the bycatch of marine mammals in fisheries represents the greatest source of human-caused mortality that threatens the sustainability of many populations and species. The Australian sea lion ( Neophoca cinerea ) is an endangered species, whose populations off South Australia (SA) have been subject to bycatch in a demersal gillnet fishery targeting sharks since the 1960s. A comprehensive assessment was undertaken of sea lion bycatch mortality that combined independent fishery observer data with species distribution models (underpinned by satellite tracking, abundance data and population modeling) to model the relationship between at-sea foraging effort and bycatch rate. Combined with the distribution of fishing effort, these models enabled the overall level of bycatch mortality to be estimated by age, sex and subpopulation, facilitating population viability analyses that indicated most subpopulations were declining, and subject to unsustainable levels of bycatch mortality. To reduce this mortality, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority implemented an Australian Sea Lion Management Strategy that included an independent observer program (ultimately 100\% electronic monitoring of gillnet fishing off SA), permanent spatial gillnet closures around all sea lion breeding sites, bycatch mortality limits that triggered temporal (18 months) spatial closures when zone-specific bycatch trigger limits were reached, and incentives for gillnet fishers to switch to an alternate fishing method (longlines). The Strategy had immediate impacts on the fishery: it resulted in significant reductions in gillnet fishing effort and on the reported bycatch of sea lions. In the next decade, there was an estimated 98\% reduction in sea lion bycatch mortality from gillnet interactions and an apparent stabilization of the decline in sea lion pup abundances at some impacted breeding sites. There was an almost complete transition in the fishery from gillnets to longlines, and fishing catches returned to pre-management levels. The successful implementation of management measures to mitigate sea lion bycatch mortality in the gillnet fishery off SA was rapid, science informed, adaptive, comprehensive, and backed by strong compliance and monitoring of the fishery. It provides an important case study which demonstrates how management measures can be effectively applied to mitigate bycatch mortality of marine mammals and other marine protected species.},

	abstract = {Sustainable seafood initiatives began with efforts to promote and certify seafood sourced from well-managed stocks caught with a reduced impact on the marine environment. More recently, social equity in fisheries has been the subject of increased concern with suggestions that seafood cannot be certified as sustainable if its production results in social harm, such as unfair wages or the use of forced or child labour. Together with local seafood, which has been promoted as an eco-friendly and socially conscious alternative to globally sourced seafood, these initiatives signal a growing interest in fisheries as a social–ecological system. However, this increasingly complex landscape of environmental sustainability and social justice may be difficult for the public and seafood consumers to navigate. Here, we investigate consumer understanding of and responsiveness to a range of seafood sustainability initiatives by testing preferences and willingness to pay (WTP) for seafood across the three types of sustainability: ecological sustainability, local origin and social sustainability. More than half of respondents demonstrated good understandings of both ecological sustainability and social sustainability with respect to seafood, and respondents were willing to pay more for all three types of sustainability. However, WTP for social sustainability benefits was the lowest, and consumers perceived a high degree of overlap of these benefits with those from locally sourced seafood. These results indicate that seafood certification taking a system-wide approach has potential to succeed, but that it will need to emerge in concert with the increased public education about social problems associated with globalized fisheries.},

	abstract = {Over the last two decades, efforts to combat illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing have led to an expansion of initiatives to enhance transparency across the seafood industry through international agreements, national government regulations, and voluntary private initiatives. Understanding of the effects of these initiatives remains limited, and approaches contested among stakeholders. Yet similar transparency initiatives introduced in recent decades across other sectors whose goal is to expand sustainability in global supply chains, may offer applicable lessons for seafood sustainability. Through a comparative review of transparency initiatives adopted in apparel, extractives, and timber supply chains, this study draws out lessons to inform efforts to expand transparency in seafood supply chains in order to combat illegal fishing. Across the literature reviewed on these three industries and seafood, there was mixed consensus that the initiatives met their intended sustainability goals or significantly affected costs and revenues, based on the evidence available. The review finds a trend across the three industries for increased transparency initiatives in international supply chains, which are often voluntary or state-based initiatives. This trend was commonly motivated by expanded trade and reputational risks from consumer demand, and external pressure from civil society. Transparency initiatives were often driven by governments, lead firms, and markets from developed countries. Conversely the resources and/or producers targeted by the transparency activities have been more widely dispersed worldwide, with many located in developing countries. Comparing across the sectors, lessons learned are distilled to inform efforts aiming to expand transparency in seafood supply chains.},

The highest concentrations of pollutants were found in sharks occupying top trophic levels (Carcharhiniformes and Lamniformes).

	abstract = {Shore-based shark fishing in Florida is rarely monitored as it largely occurs at night on remote beaches and has received a questionable reputation after recent exposure of illegal activity. While these events have led to calls for better management and enforcement, the characteristics of the fishery itself remain largely unknown. Our study, therefore, provides the first comprehensive profile of the Florida shore-based shark fishery to inform fisheries management and conservation. We distributed an online survey to all Florida Fish and Wildlife shore-based shark fishing permit holders to gather data on angler sociodemographics, fishing preferences, habits, motivations, and perceptions of shark conservation. We identified three angler typologies that differed primarily by shark fishing experience and frequency: (1) experienced infrequent anglers, (2) skilled frequent anglers, and (3) novice infrequent anglers. Our results revealed that the Florida recreational shore-based shark fishery itself has increased in participation fivefold since 2010 and generates approximately US\$7.8 million (95\% CI = \$7.2– 8.5 million) annually in equipment expenditures and \$34.3 million (\$30.4–38.1 million) annually in fishing trips. Surveyed anglers caught a total of 9,617 sharks within a 12-month period, averaging 11 sharks/angler, and the most preferred target species was the Blacktip Shark Carcharhinus limbatus. Angler motivations for participating in this fishery were grouped into the following categories: leisure and well-being, experience of the catch, and consumption. Perceptions of shark conservation and management were generally positive; however, many anglers did not believe that recreational fishing negatively impacts shark populations. Most anglers expressed a desire to learn more about handling practices that benefited sharks, which may help managers implement more educational opportunities and communication efforts. Understanding the characteristics and perspectives of anglers from the shore-based shark fishery in Florida is crucial for highlighting potential management pathways and estimating angler acceptance of management.},

	abstract = {Many important areas identified for conservation priorities focus on areas of high species richness, however, it is unclear whether these areas change depending on what aspect of richness is considered (e.g. evolutionary distinctiveness, endemicity, or threatened species). Furthermore, little is known of the extent of spatial congruency between biodiversity measures in the marine realm. Here, we used the distribution maps of all known marine sharks, rays, and chimaeras (class Chondrichthyes) to examine the extent of spatial congruency across the hotspots of three measures of species richness: total number of species, evolutionarily distinct species, and endemic species. We assessed the spatial congruency between hotspots considering all species, as well as on the subset of the threatened species only. We consider three definitions of hotspot (2.5\%, 5\%, and 10\% of cells with the highest numbers of species) and three levels of spatial resolution (1°, 4°, and 8° grid cells). Overall, we found low congruency among all three measures of species richness, with the threatened species comprising a smaller subset of the overall species patterns irrespective of hotspot definition. Areas of congruency at 1° and 5\% richest cells contain over half (64\%) of all sharks and rays and occurred off the coasts of: (1) Northern Mexico Gulf of California, (2) USA Gulf of Mexico, (3) Ecuador, (4) Uruguay and southern Brazil, (5) South Africa, southern Mozambique, and southern Namibia, (6) Japan, Taiwan, and parts of southern China, and (7) eastern and western Australia. Coarsening resolution increases congruency twofold for all species but remains relatively low for threatened measures, and geographic locations of congruent areas also change. Finally, for pairwise comparisons of biodiversity measures, evolutionarily distinct species richness had the highest overlap with total species richness regardless of resolution or definition of hotspot. We suggest that focusing conservation attention solely on areas of high total species richness will not necessarily contribute efforts towards species that are most at risk, nor will it protect other important dimensions of species richness.},

	abstract = {Fishing with modified gillnets was conducted to elucidate their potential for reducing shark bycatch. Experimental fishing focused on two commercial fisheries, Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus maculatus) and spot (Leiostomus xanthurus). The modification took the form of increasing the gillnet tension using larger floats on the head-rope and increasing the lead-core lead-line weight. Gillnet mesh sizes were 7.2 cm (spot fishery) and 7.6 and 10.2 cm (Spanish mackerel fishery). Gillnet selectivity of the four most commonly encountered shark species were fitted to fork-length distribution data using the SELECT method. There was no significant difference in the catch rate of the target species between control and modified gillnets for all mesh sizes used. Catch rates of some shark species were significantly reduced in modified gillnets. Model deviance values indicated good fits to the data for blacknose (Carcharhinus acronotus), blacktip (Carcharhinus limbatus) and bonnethead (Sphyrna tiburo) sharks with lowest deviance values (i.e., best fit) generally associated with the normal scale (spread proportional to mesh size) form. The selectivity results demonstrated that all life stages of Atlantic sharpnose (Rhizoprionodon terraenovae) and blacknose sharks were available to the gillnets. The mesh selectivity of bonnethead sharks was largely uniform due to their exaggerated cepholaphoil that resulted in the majority being hammer-wrapped. Further, capture data indicated a dominance of large juveniles and adult bonnethead sharks resulting in poor model fits. The capture mortality rate for all shark species was high (78.6\%) with higher mortality rates associated with heightened locomotor performance and wrapping as an entanglement mode. These results demonstrated that modified gillnets have the potential to reduce shark bycatch, particularly for those species for which wrapping was the primary entanglement mode. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The fishery collapsed by the 1920s when {\textless}1\% of the previous peak catch was removed. Despite closures of the fishery, lake sturgeon remain rare in Lake Erie. We applied a depletion-based stock reduction analysis (DB-SRA) to the catch of lake sturgeon from 1879 to 1929 to gain estimates of sustainable fishery reference points and the historic carrying capacity of Lake Erie for lake sturgeon. We also simulated population growth of lake sturgeon from 1929 to the present with varying assumptions of the current carrying capacity of the lake. The estimated historic carrying capacity of lake sturgeon was 22,652 metric tons. During the height of the fishery, exploitation was as high as 37\% which was more than an order of magnitude greater than that required for maximum sustainable yield. Projections of the population from 1929 to 2016 suggest sufficient time has passed since the collapse of the fishery that the population should have recovered to levels that would support a fishery at maximum sustainable yield. However, lake sturgeon remain rare in Lake Erie indicating that other factors such as habitat availability may be limiting their recovery. Our estimates of carrying capacity will be informative when setting recovery targets which consider the amount of habitat loss.},

Scaling up observed catches (discards) of a single vessel to potential discards made by a single nation's fleet in the region, we estimate a mean annual total of 1526.2 t (±1 S.D. range: 415.3–2637.0 t), which exceeds by 89.2 times (±1 S.D. range: 24.3–154.2 times) the official reported discards for these three species.

	abstract = {Understanding the status of fish stocks is a critical step in ensuring the ecological and economic sustainability of marine ecosystems. However, at least half of global catch and a vast majority of global fisheries lack formal stock assessments, largely due to a lack of sufficient data. Catch data, loosely referring to any catch records be it inclusive of discards or not, are the only type of fishery data available across a wide range of fisheries at a global scale. This has given rise to a long list of so-called “catch-only” models, intended to estimate aspects of stock status based primarily on characteristics of a fishery's catch history. In this paper, we review the history, performance and potential of “catch-only” models to estimate stock biomass status. While individual catch-only models often report good performance, repeated efforts to examine the performance of these models have consistently found them to be imprecise and biased when applied to new data-limited fisheries. We demonstrate that a large reason for this is the simple lack of information on stock status contained in the shape of a catch history alone. Off-the-shelf use of catch-only models can lead to poor and biased estimates of stock status, potentially hindering efforts at effective management.},

It uses time series of catches and two priors, one for the intrinsic population growth rate derived from life history parameters, and another for stock depletion based on catch trends. The method applies an optimization algorithm to search the potential parameter space. All computations are model or equation based rather than using predefined rules. The utility of this method is demonstrated by applying it to 13 stocks in Australia that are assessed using Stock Synthesis - an assessment package that can make use of a variety of data sources. The estimated parameters, including carrying capacity, intrinsic population growth rate, maximum sustainable yield, and depletion from the catch-only method are broadly comparable with those from the full assessments.

	abstract = {Fishery managers must often reconcile conflicting estimates of population status and trend. Superensemble models, commonly used in climate and weather forecasting, may provide an effective solution. This approach uses predictions from multiple models as covariates in an additional “superensemble” model fitted to known data. We evaluated the potential for ensemble averages and superensemble models (ensemble methods) to improve estimates of population status and trend for fisheries. We fit four widely applicable data-limited models that estimate stock biomass relative to equilibrium biomass at maximum sustainable yield (B/BMSY). We combined these estimates of recent fishery status and trends in B/BMSY with four ensemble methods: an ensemble average and three superensembles (a linear model, a random forest and a boosted regression tree). We trained our superensembles on 5,760 simulated stocks and tested them with cross-validation and against a global database of 249 stock assessments. Ensemble methods substantially improved estimates of population status and trend. Random forest and boosted regression trees performed the best at estimating population status: inaccuracy (median absolute proportional error) decreased from 0.42 – 0.56 to 0.32 – 0.33, rank-order correlation between predicted and true status improved from 0.02 – 0.32 to 0.44 – 0.48 and bias (median proportional error) declined from −0.22 – 0.31 to −0.12 – 0.03. We found similar improvements when predicting trend and when applying the simulation-trained superensembles to catch data for global fish stocks. Superensembles can optimally leverage multiple model predictions; however, they must be tested, formed from a diverse set of accurate models and built on a data set representative of the populations to which they are applied.},

	abstract = {Many of the world's fisheries are unassessed, with little information about population status or risk of overfishing. Unassessed fisheries are particularly predominant in developing countries and in small-scale fisheries, where they are important for food security. Several catch-only methods based on time series of fishery catch and commonly available life-history traits have been developed to estimate stock status (defined as biomass relative to biomass at maximum sustainable yield: B/BMSY). While their stock status performance has been extensively studied, performance of catch-only models as a management tool is unknown. We evaluated the extent to which a superensemble of three prominent catch-only models can provide a reliable basis for fisheries management and how performance compares across management strategies that control catch or fishing effort. We used a management strategy evaluation framework to determine whether a superensemble of catch-only models can reliably inform harvest control rules (HCRs). Across five simulated fish life histories and two harvest-dynamic types, catch-only models and HCR combinations reduced the risk of overfishing and increased the proportion of stocks above BMSY compared to business as usual, though often resulted in poor yields. Precautionary HCRs based on fishing effort were robust and insensitive to error in catch-only models, while catch-based HCRs caused high probabilities of overfishing and more overfished populations. Catch-only methods tended to overestimate B/BMSY for our simulated data sets. The catch-only superensemble combined with precautionary effort-based HCRs could be part of a stepping stone approach for managing some data-limited stocks while working towards more data-moderate assessment methods.},

Even though in many countries they are moving to closed-loop simulations to assess the performance of different management procedures in data-limited situations, managers in most developing countries are still demanding information on stock status. In this study we use the common metric of harvest rate to evaluate and compare the performance of the following catch-only and length-only assessment models: Catch – maximum sustainable yield (Catch-MSY), depletion-based stock reduction analysis (DBSRA), simple Stock Synthesis (SSS), an extension of Catch-MSY (CMSY), length-based spawning potential ratio (LBSPR), length-based integrated mixed effects (LIME), and length-based Bayesian (LBB). In general, results were more biased for slightly depleted than for highly depleted stocks and for long-lived than for short-lived species. Length-based models, such as LIME, performed as well as catch-based methods in many scenarios, and among the catch-based models, the one with the best performance was SSS followed by CMSY.},

Fifty-three percent (414 stocks) are below BMSY and of these, 265 are estimated to be below 80\% of the BMSY level. While the 149 stocks above 80\% of BMSY are conventionally considered “fully exploited,” stocks staying at this level for many years, forego substantial yield. Our results enable managers to consider more detailed information than simply a categorization of stocks as “fully” or “over” exploited. Our approach is reproducible, allows consistent application to a broad range of stocks, and can be easily updated as new data become available.

As a case study, COMs are used to assess a northern pike Esox lucius L. stock around the German Baltic island of Rügen. Multiple COMs were fitted to a time series of total pike removals, and their outputs were used as explanatory variables in ensemble models. The stock was found to be fully exploited and currently declining. This study highlights the potential for using COMs to determine status of previously unassessed coastal and freshwater stocks facing recreational fishing pressure and demonstrates how incorporating recreational removals is crucial for achieving reliable insights into the status of mixed-use stocks.},

We identify and discuss advantages and challenges of ensemble modelling approaches in the context of scientific advice. There are uncertainties associated with every phase in the stock assessment process: data collection, assessment model choice, model assumptions, interpretation of risk, up to the implementation of management advice. Additionally, the dynamics of fish populations are complex, and our incomplete understanding of those dynamics and limited observations of important mechanisms, necessitate that models are simpler than nature. The aim is for the model to capture enough of the dynamics to accurately estimate trends and abundance, and provide the basis for robust advice about sustainable harvests. The status quo approach to assessment modelling has been to identify the "best"model and generate advice from that model, mostly ignoring advice from other model configurations regardless of how closely they performed relative to the chosen model. We discuss and make suggestions about the utility of ensemble models, including revisions to the formal process of providing advice to management bodies, and recommend further research to evaluate potential gains in modelling and advice performance.},

Still, there is a general perception that populations of large ocean predators cover wide areas and therefore their diversity is less susceptible to local anthropogenic disturbance. Here we report retrospective genomic analyses of DNA using archived and contemporary samples of tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) from eastern Australia. Using SNP loci, we documented a signicant overall change in genetic composition of tiger sharks born over the last century. The change was most likely due to a shift over time in the relative contribution of two well differentiated, but hitherto cryptic populations. Our data strongly indicate a dramatic shift in relative contribution of the two populations to the overall tiger shark abundance of the east coast of Australia, possibly associated with differences in direct or indirect exploitation rates.},

However, a review of the literature suggests that a two-phase growth model could better describe growth in elasmobranchs. We compare the two-phase growth model (TPGM) with the VBGM for 18 data sets of elasmobranch species, by fitting the models to 36 age-length-at-age data pairs available. The Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) and the difference in AIC between both models revealed that in 23 cases the probability that the TPGM was true ≥50\%. The VBGM tends to estimate larger L∞ values than the two-phase growth model, while the k parameter tends to be underestimated. The growth rate in length-at-age appears tends to decrease near the age at first maturity in several species of elasmobranch. The importance of the TPGM lies in that it may better describe this aspect of the life history of many elasmobranchs. In this context, we conclude that the TPGM should be used along with other growth models in order to precisely estimate elasmobranch life history parameters. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.},

	abstract = {Age, growth, and reproduction of the spinner shark, Carcharhinus brevipinna (Müller and Henle, 1938), are described from 383 specimens (193 females and 190 males) collected from Oct. 1995 to Sep. 1996 in waters off northeastern Taiwan. Annuli in precaudal vertebrae form once a year and numbered up to 21 and 17 for females and males, respectively. The von Bertalanffy growth parameters estimates, based on age and back-calculated length data, were as follows: asymptotic (L∞) = 288.2 cm total length (TL), growth coefficient (k) = 0.151/yr, age at 0 length (t0) = -1.988 yr for females; and L∞= 257.4 cm TL, k = 0.203/yr, t0 = -1.709 yr for males. The growth rate for females was estimated to be 29.9 cm for the 1st year, and then decreased from 25.7 to 16.3 cm/yr for years 2-5, from 14.0 to 7.7 cm/yr for years 6-10, and from 6.6 to 1.7 cm/yr for years 11-20. Growth rate for males was 33.4 cm/yr for the 1st year, then decreased from 27.3 to 14.8 cm/yr for years 2-5, from 12.1 to 5.4 cm/yr for years 6-10, and from 4.4 to 0.7 cm/yr for years 11-20. The mean total lengths at maturity were estimated to be 222.5 and 220.5 cm for females and males, which corresponded to 7.8 and 7.9 yr, respectively. Evidence suggested a 2 yr reproductive cycle in females, with a gestation period of 10-12 mo. Carcharhinus brevipinna is viviparous, with a yolk-sac placenta. The number of embryos per litter (N) was 3-14 (mean, 8.5), and it increased with the size of the mother (N = -45.06 + 0.198TL).

Yet much of what is known about sharks has been inferred from catch records in industrial fisheries, whereas far less information is available about sharks that live in coastal habitats3. Here we address this knowledge gap using data from more than 15,000 standardized baited remote underwater video stations that were deployed on 371 reefs in 58 nations to estimate the conservation status of reef sharks globally. Our results reveal the profound impact that fishing has had on reef shark populations: we observed no sharks on almost 20\% of the surveyed reefs. Reef sharks were almost completely absent from reefs in several nations, and shark depletion was strongly related to socio-economic conditions such as the size and proximity of the nearest market, poor governance and the density of the human population. However, opportunities for the conservation of reef sharks remain: shark sanctuaries, closed areas, catch limits and an absence of gillnets and longlines were associated with a substantially higher relative abundance of reef sharks. These results reveal several policy pathways for the restoration and management of reef shark populations, from direct top-down management of fishing to indirect improvement of governance conditions. Reef shark populations will only have a high chance of recovery by engaging key socio-economic aspects of tropical fisheries.},

	abstract = {The narrow sawfish Anoxypristis cuspidata belongs to the most endangered family of chondrichthyan fishes, the sawfishes (Pristidae). This species has undergone significant de - clines in geographic range and abundance due to anthropogenic activities including fishing and habitat destruction. Very little is known of adult movements within its distribution. In order to better manage and protect this endangered species, understanding patterns of habitat use, connectivity and behaviour is important. Using a combination of partial mitochondrial sequences (control region [CR] and NADH dehydrogenase 4 [ND4]) and nuclear markers (microsatellites), this study assessed the genetic population structure of A. cuspidata in Australia and Papua New Guinea. Significant population structuring using mitochondrial DNA was found between the east Australian coast, Gulf of Papua and Gulf of Carpentaria (using concatenated CR and ND4 markers) (analysis of molecular variance [AMOVA], ΦST = 0.082, p = {\textless} 0.001). In contrast, no population structure was evident across northern Australia using nuclear microsatellite loci (FST = 0.012, p = 1.000). Our results suggest that a combination of historic genetic drift, maternal natal philopatry and possible male-biased dispersal likely drive the genetic patterns observed. Given the endangered status and lack of knowledge for A. cuspidata, this study presents important insights that may be used to inform management efforts.},

This paper provides the first comprehensive review of the published and unpublished literature on sawfish records in PNG. It also collates information for all sawfish specimens in the holdings of museum and fisheries collections, dating back to the late 1800s. Opportunistic sampling during a shark and ray biodiversity project in PNG has resulted in contemporary records for all 4 sawfish species known to occur in the region (i.e. Anoxypristis cuspidata, Pristis clavata, P. pristis and P. zijsron) and identification of suitable habitat for the species across PNG. A review of the literature shows that declines in sawfish populations have occurred in a number of locations. Detailed surveys of the key areas highlighted in this study are urgently required to assess the current status of sawfish in PNG. This information is crucial for developing a global strategy for sawfish conservation and fisheries management, given the apparent persistence of all 4 Indo-Pacific species in PNG.},

	abstract = {Age-structured production models (ASPMs) are often preferred over biomass aggregated surplus production models (SPMs) as the former can track the propagation of cohorts and explicitly account for the effects of selective fishing, even in the absence of reliable size- or age data. Here, we introduce ‘JABBA-Select’, an extension of the JABBA software (Just Another Bayesian Biomass Assessment; Winker et al., 2018), that is able to overcome some of the shortcomings of conventional SPMs and allows a direct comparison to ASPMs. JABBA-Select incorporates life history parameters and fishing selectivity and distinguishes between exploitable biomass (used to fit indices given fishery selectivity) and spawning biomass (used to predict surplus production). Applying JABBA-Select involves using an age-structured equilibrium model to convert the input parameters into multivariate normal priors for surplus-production productivity parameters. We illustrate the main elements of JABBA-Select using the stock parameters of South African silver kob (Argyrosomus inodorus, Scienidae) as a case study. This species is exploited by multiple fisheries and was selected as an example of a data moderate fishery that features strong contrast in selectivity over time and across fleets. For proof-of-concept, we use an age-structured simulation framework to compare the performance of JABBA-Select to: 1) a conventional Bayesian state-space model using a Pella-Tomlinson (PT) production function, 2) an ASPM with deterministic recruitment; and 3) an ASPM with stochastic recruitment. The PT model produced biased estimates of relative and absolute spawning biomass trajectories and associated reference points, which by contrast could be fairly accurately estimated by JABBA-Select. JABBA-Select performed at least as well as the ASPMs in accuracy for most of the performance metrics and best characterized the stock status uncertainty. The results indicate that JABBA-Select is able to accurately account for moderate changes in selectivity and fleet dynamics over time and to provide a robust tool for data-moderate stock assessments.},

The MSL was calculated from the average inferred size-box categories of a species weighted by their annual catch. The use of MSL allows determining inter-annual changes in the size of the catch when weighted data is available from the fishery. Using the Portuguese fisheries landing data as an example, the MSL revealed that the landing yield of large fish linearly declined over time while the catch of small fishes increased (i.e., survivors to old age was reduced by fishing). The MSL can be easily used to assess trends in marine exploited commercial communities (community rather than population level) and is fully applicable with any species-size data source (e.g., scientific surveys, visual census data). The MSL can also be applied as a key indicator within the new ecosystem-based Marine Policy Framework Strategy (ecosystem approach to fisheries), which required the use of size-based indicators for the assessment of fisheries trends in exploited marine communities.},

	abstract = {Fishermen frequently switch their target fish species without documenting changes in which species they are targeting and the fishing practices used, generating misleading catchability information about the fish caught. To date, changes in target species have been incorporated in stock assessments at two different levels in analyses. First, these changes are taken into account during the parameterization of generalized linear models used to compute the CPUE index standardization. Second, changes in target species are directly incorporated as a time-varying catchability parameter during the fitting of the dynamic model used for the assessment. Here, we present an alternative method for this incorporation by specifying a single change point in the stationary distribution of the catchability coefficient in a Bayesian state-space production model. Two models were fitted to the time series of the south Atlantic blue shark (Prionace glauca) stock. In one of the models, only one catchability coefficient was estimated. In the other model, a change point was included, and two catchability coefficients were estimated, one before the change point, and the other after. Despite the latter model introducing an extra parameter, it produced a significantly better fit than the modeling approach without the change point. Although including a single change point in the catchability coefficient had no significant impact on the status of south Atlantic blue shark (which is still above BMSY), it provided a robust way of accounting for changes in catchability as a result of fishermen changing target species. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

We used Monte Carlo simulations to determine whether the results were sensitive to uncertainty about natural mortality, asymptotic length, growth rate and length at maturity. We found that black grouper Mycteroperca bonaci is overfished, and Nassau grouper Epinephelus striatus, schoolmaster snapper Lutjanus apodus and mutton snapper Lutjanus analis are probably overfished, but hogfish Lachnolaimus maximus, stoplight parrotfish Sparisoma viride, French angelfish Pomacanthus paru and gray angelfish Pomacanthus arcuatus are probably not overfished. All species except French angelfish were experiencing overfishing across a range of life history parameters. Nassau grouper, black grouper and mutton snapper were often caught below the size at maturity Lm. The results were sensitive to different assumed values of the life history parameters. Life history parameters can vary regionally for many reef fishes, and there have been few life history studies in the western Caribbean; such studies would greatly improve estimates of stock status. We also calculated six multispecies indicators of fishery status. The mean length relative to Lm was greater than 1.0 and constant between 2005 and 2011. Mean trophic level, mean maximum size, and fraction piscivores increased between 2005 and 2011, partly due to the fact that parrotfish, previously an important component of the catch, have been prohibited beginning in 2009. Mean catch per unit effort declined. Given that black grouper, Nassau grouper, mutton snapper and schoolmaster snapper are found to be overfished and experiencing overfishing under most values of the life history parameters, we recommend size or catch limits for these species. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {SUMMARY The large fish indicator (LFI), or 'proportion of fish greater than 40 cm length in bottom trawl surveys,' is a frequently debated indicator of Good Environmental Status in European regional seas. How does the LFI respond to changes in fishing pressure? This question is addressed here through analysis of fine-scale spatial trends in the LFI within the North Sea, compared between two periods of contrasting fisheries management: 1983-1999 and 2000-2012, respectively, before and after the onset of the European Union's fleet reduction scheme. Over the entire period, the LFI has decreased in large parts of the North Sea. However, most of the decline was from 1983-1999; since 2000 the LFI has improved in much of the North Sea, especially in UK waters. Comparison with international effort data shows that those western areas where the LFI has improved correspond with regions where otter trawl effort has decreased since 2000 (and previously was highest in the 1990s), and also with decreases in beam trawl effort. This study provides strong support that recent European effort reduction schemes are now beginning to result in an improved ecosystem state as indicated by the regional-scale improvement in the LFI.},

	abstract = {Problematic Humans are able to accurately track a moving object with a combi-nation of saccades and smooth eye movements. These movements allow us to align and stabilize the object on the fovea, thus en-abling high-resolution visual detection. When predictive informa-tion is available about target motion, anticipatory smooth pursuit eye movements (aSPEM) are efficiently generated before target appearance, which reduce the typical sensorimotor delay between target motion onset and foveation. It is generally assumed that the role of anticipatory eye movements is to limit the behavioral impairment due to eye-to-target position and velocity mismatch. By manipulating the probability for target motion direction we were able to bias the direction and mean velocity of aSPEM, as mea-sured during a fixed duration gap before target ramp-motion onset. This suggests that probabilistic information may be used to inform the internal representation of motion prediction for the initiation of anticipatory movements [1]. However, such estimate may become particularly challenging in a dynamic context, where the probabilistic contingencies vary in time in an unpredictable way. In addition, whether and how the infor-mation processing underlying the buildup of aSPEM is linked to an explicit estimate of probabilities is unknown. Material and Method In order to answer these questions, we have set up an experi-ment comprising 3 blocks of 200 trials. For each trial, a tar-get makes either to the left or to the right, this direction being drawn from a Bernoulli process. The probability of this process varied in a piecewise-constant (that is, a step function varying be-tween 0 and 1), similarly to Meyniel et al. [2]. The occurence of these switches is itself drawn from a Bernoulli process of probability p switch = 1/40. We asked subjects to perform two tasks on different days :},

Use of 2-parameter stock-recruitment relationships (SRRs) consequently restricts the ability to fully quantify the uncertainty associated with estimating BMSY and FMSY because 2-parameter SRRs restrict the potential range of values for BMSY/B0. In principle, BMSY/B0 and FMSY can be more independent if the stock-recruitment relationship is more general than these 2-parameter SRRs. This paper outlines eleven potential 3-parameter stock-recruitment relationships and evaluates them in terms of whether they are able to match a wide range of specifications for BMSY (expressed relative to unfished spawning stock biomass, B0) and FMSY (expressed relative to natural mortality, M). Of the eleven 3-parameter stock-recruitment relationships considered, the Ricker-Power stock-recruitment relationship is found to best satisfy the characteristics of (a) being able to mimic a wide range of BMSY/B0 and FMSY/M values, (b) not to lead to negative recruitment for biomasses between 0 and B0, and (c) not to lead to increasing recruitment while approaching the limit of zero population size. Bayesian assessments of three example groundfish species off the US west coast (aurora rockfish, petrale sole, and cabezon) are conducted using Simple Stock Synthesis based on the Beverton-Holt and Ricker-Power stock-recruitment relationships to illustrate some of the impacts of allowing for a 3-parameter stock-recruitment relationship.},

	abstract = {Priors are existing information or beliefs that are needed in Bayesian analysis. Informative priors are important in obtaining the Bayesian posterior distributions for estimated parameters in stock assessment. In the case of the steepness parameter (A), the need for an informative prior is particularly important because it determines the stock-recruitment relationships in the model. However, specifications of the priors for the h parameter are often subjective. We used a simple population model to derive h priors based on life history considerations. The model was based on the evolutionary principle that persistence of any species, given its life history (i.e., natural mortality rate) and its exposure to recruitment variability, requires a minimum recruitment compensation that enables the species to rebound consistently from low critical abundances (Nc). Using the model, we derived the prior probability distributions of the h parameter for fish species that have a range of natural mortality, recruitment variabilities, and Nc values.},

As fisheries worldwide enter deeper waters, the provision of biological data for these little-known taxa is critical to management and conservation. The shortspine spurdog, Squalus cf. mitsukurii, is an abundant shark on the insular slopes of the Hawaiian Islands. We assigned ages by counting growth bands on the enamel caps of both dorsal fin spines. Age estimates ranged from 3 to 26 years for females and from 6 to 23 years for males. Growth was modelled with multiple length-at-age models, fitted using maximum likelihood estimation and nonlinear least-squares methods. For female data, the logistic model yielded the most biologically cogent parameter estimates (L ∞=126 cm (total length, TL) and k=0.080 year -1). The two-parameter von Bertalanffy Growth Model yielded optimal model fit and realistic parameter estimates for males (L ∞=72 cm (TL) and k=0.080 year -1). Maturity ogives suggested that females and males mature at 64-cm TL (15 years) and 47-cm TL (8.5 years), respectively. Fecundity ranged from 3 to 10 embryos; mating appeared to be aseasonal. We reveal a conservative life history, common among deep-water elasmobranchs, and provide further evidence of geographic variation in reproductive and growth parameters in this nominal species. © CSIRO 2011.},

Sixty-two teleost species were observed in the catch of which 20 were routinely discarded. The most commonly discarded teleosts were western buffalo bream/silver drummer, Kyphosus cornelii/K. sydneyanus, and dusky morwong, Dactylophora nigricans. Annual discards peaked in the 1990s; nonetheless, current discard levels, 36.9 ± 2.1 (S.E.) t yearÀ1, are much lower than the overall annual retained catches (c. 1000 t yearÀ1).

	abstract = {Many fisheries in the world are data-moderate, with data types (e.g., total removals, abundance indices, and biological composition data) of varied quality (e.g., limited time series or representative samples) or available data. Integrated stock assessments are useful tools for data-moderate fisheries as they can include all available information, can be updated due to the availability of more information over time, and can directly test the inclusion and exclusion of specific data types. This study uses the simulation testing and systematic data reduction from the US West Coast benchmark assessments to examine the performance of Stock Synthesis with catch and length (SS-CL) compositions only. The simulation testing of various life histories, recruitment variabilities, and data availability scenarios found that the correctly specified SS-CL can estimate unbiased key population quantities such as stock status with as little as 1 year of length data although 5 years or more may be more reliable. The error in key population quantities is decreased with an increase in years and the sample size of length data. The removal of the length compositions from benchmark assessments often caused large model deviations in the outputs compared to the removal of other data sources, indicating the importance of length data in integrated models. Models with catch and length data, excluding abundance indices and age composition, generally provided informative estimates of the stock status relative to the reference model, with most data scenarios falling within the CIs of the reference model. The results of simulation analysis and systematic data reduction indicated that SS-CL is potentially viable for data-moderate assessments in the USA, thus reducing precautionary buffers on catch limits for many stocks previously assessed in a lower tier using catch-only models. SS-CL could also be applied to many stocks around the world, maximizing the use of data available via the well tested, multifeature benefits of SS.},

Several approaches have been developed for identifying networks of globally important areas based on the delineation of sites or seascapes of importance for various elements of biodiversity (e.g., birds, marine mammals). Sharks, rays, and chimaeras are facing a biodiversity crisis with an estimated 37\% of species threatened with extinction driven by overfishing. Yet spatial planning tools often fail to consider the habitat needs critical for their survival. The Important Shark and Ray Area (ISRA) approach is proposed as a response to the dire global status of sharks, rays, and chimaeras. A set of four globally standardized scientific criteria, with seven sub-criteria, was developed based on input collated during four shark, biodiversity, and policy expert workshops conducted in 2022. The ISRA Criteria provide a framework to identify discrete, three-dimensional portions of habitat important for one or more shark, ray, or chimaera species, that have the potential to be delineated and managed for conservation. The ISRA Criteria can be applied to all environments where sharks occur (marine, estuarine, and freshwater) and consider the diversity of species, their complex behaviors and ecology, and biological needs. The identification of ISRAs will guide the development, design, and application of area-based conservation initiatives for sharks, rays, and chimaeras, and contribute to their recovery.},

In striking contrast to what has been previously reported, we demonstrate that the common blacktip shark is not rare in northern Australia but occurs in approximately equal frequencies with the Australian blacktip shark. Management of shark resources in northern Australia needs to take account of this new information. Species identification was performed using nucleotide sequences of the control, NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 (ND4) and cytochrome oxidase I (COI) regions in the mitochondrial genome. The proportion of overall genetic variation (FST) between the two species was small (0.042, P {\textless} 0.01) based on allele frequencies at five microsatellite loci. We confirm that a third blacktip species (C. amblyrhynchoides, graceful shark) is closely related to C. tilstoni and C. limbatus and can be distinguished from them on the basis of mtDNA sequences from two gene regions. The Australian blacktip shark (C. tilstoni) was not encountered among 20 samples from central Indonesia that were later confirmed to be common blacktip and graceful sharks.

Estimates of age and growth for the white shark from the eastern North Pacific Ocean indicate they have a slow growth rate and a relatively high longevity. Age, growth, and longevity estimates useful for stock assessment and fishery models, however, require some form of validation. By counting vertebral growth band pairs, ages can be estimated, but because not all sharks deposit annual growth bands and many are not easily discernable, it is necessary to validate growth band periodicity with an independent method. Radiocarbon (14C) age validation uses the discrete 14C signal produced from thermonuclear testing in the 1950s and 1960s that is retained in skeletal structures as a time-specific marker. Growth band pairs in vertebrae, estimated as annual and spanning the 1930s to 1990s, were analyzed for +�14C and stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes (+�13C and +�15N). The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of 14C age validation for a wide-ranging species with a complex life history and to use stable isotope measurements in vertebrae as a means of resolving complexity introduced into the 14C chronology by ontogenetic shifts in diet and habitat. Stable isotopes provided useful trophic position information; however, validation of age estimates was confounded by what may have been some combination of the dietary source of carbon to the vertebrae, large-scale movement patterns, and steep 14C gradients with depth in the eastern North Pacific Ocean},

	abstract = {The giant lantern shark, Etmopterus baxteri, is taken as bycatch of commercial fisheries that operate in deepwater off southeastern Australia. Bands on the second dorsal spine were used to obtain age estimates. The number of bands on the external surface of the spine and within the inner dentine layer increased with animal length. Most spines had more bands on the external surface, and the rate of band formation was significantly different between the external surface and the inner dentine layer. Females had a maximum of 57 external bands and 26 internal bands, while males had up to 48 external bands and 22 internal bands. Age estimates from external bands suggest maturity (A 50) at 20 years for males and 30 years for females. Internal band age estimates suggest maturity at 10.5 years for males and 11.5 years for females. Although there is a large discrepancy between these two preliminary (i.e., unvalidated) age estimates, they both suggest that E. baxteri is a long-lived and late maturing species that is likely to be susceptible to over fishing},

	abstract = {The movement of bonnetheads, Sphyrna tiburo, within an estuarine system on the Gulf of Mexico coast of Florida was examined to define response to salinity change. Shark presence and movements were evaluated by acoustic monitoring and gillnet sampling. Acoustic monitoring data were used to investigate active selection of different zones within the estuary based on differences in salinity among zones. Sharks were monitored for 187-�days in 2003 and 217-�days in 2004 in salinities ranging from 11.0 to 31.0-�ppt in 2003 and 15.8 to 34.6-�ppt in 2004. Monitoring data supported the hypothesis that salinity played a role in the distribution and movement of S. tiburo. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) data obtained from gillnet sampling from 1995 to 2004 were examined to determine affinity or avoidance of specific salinities within the study site as calculated using an electivity index. Electivity analysis showed almost no affinity or avoidance for specific salinity values. The difference in results between the CPUE and acoustic monitoring in relation to the potential effects of salinity likely relate to the nature of the data, with acoustic monitoring providing continuous data and CPUE providing snapshot location data. The results of this study suggest that although S. tiburo are collected within a wide range of salinity levels, salinity may affect movement and distribution. Salinity effects may be more pronounced during periods of prolonged and/or large changes in salinity as detected by long-term monitoring},

Two major, two minor and four uncommon prey groups were identified. The diet of \textit{A. rostrata} was dominated by decapod crustaceans. The Index of Relative Importance indicated that penaeid prawns and carid shrimps were the most important prey groups consumed, representing 51.84\% and 26.32\% of the diet respectively. Brachyuran crabs (12.84\%) and teleost fishes (8.86\%) were minor dietary components, while stomatopods, amphipods, isopods and squid constitute uncommon prey groups. Minor ontogenetic differences in diet were recognized, with carids significantly more important in juveniles than in adults, and penaeids, brachyurans and teleosts slightly more important in adults. The predatory activity of \textit{A. rostrata} on the benthic fauna, together with its relative abundance, suggests it may have an important role in the trophic structure of Moreton Bay.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

On average 20,000 jigged mackerel have been tagged annually with internal steel tags in the spawning area west of Ireland and the British Isles, and the tags have been recaptured in commercial catches screened through metal detectors. The spawning stock biomass estimates derived from two different tag-based models were highly variable but were on average 2 and 2.3 times higher than the ICES official estimate. The official estimate is considered uncertain and most likely an underestimate of the actual biomass, due to unregistered mortality in the fisheries and lack of fishery-independent, age-disaggregated data. Hence, tag-based estimates could potentially improve the current assessment if included in the ICES stock assessment on a regular basis. These estimates also involve some uncertainty that needs consideration, especially related to variable tagging mortality, detector efficiency and migrations of the stock},

Pigment patterns in all three regions were asymmetrical on the right and left sides making it necessary to photograph both sides to catalog each individual. However, once cataloged, an individual could be re-identified using a partial body image. Using this method, 73 individuals were identified between 2001 and 2005. Site fidelity was indicated through repeated annual sightings of individuals with 78\% of the identified sharks observed over at least 2-�years. Males were found to arrive at Guadalupe Island as early as July and females in September. Peak abundances at the site occurred August–December. The sex ratio was not significantly different from unity in 2002, 2004, and 2005.

Tiger shark catch data were gathered over 7-�years of tag and release research fishing (1991–2000, 2002–2004) in Shark Bay, Western Australia (25-�45���S, 113-�44���E). Sharks were caught using drumlines deployed in six permanent zones ( ̃3-�km2 in area). Fishing effort was standardized across days and months, and catch rates on hooks were expressed as the number of sharks caught h−1. A total of 449 individual tiger sharks was captured; 29 were recaptured. Tiger shark catch rate showed seasonal periodicity, being higher during the warm season (Sep–May) than during the cold season (Jun–Aug), and was marked by inter-annual variability. The most striking feature of the catch data was a consistent pattern of slow, continuous variation within each year from a peak during the height of the warm season (February) to a trough in the cold season (July). Annual growth rates of recaptured individuals were generally consistent with estimates from other regions, but exceeded those for populations elsewhere for sharks {\textgreater}275-�cm fork length (FL), perhaps because mature sharks in the study area rely heavily on large prey. The data suggest that (1) the threat of predation faced by animals consumed by tiger sharks fluctuates dramatically within and between years, and (2) efforts to monitor large shark abundance should be extensive enough to detect inter-annual variation and sufficiently intensive to account for intra-annual trends},

This study used photo-identification from community-contributed photographs to reveal patterns in movements, reproductive biology, and fisheries interactions in this species that have not been previously revealed through more traditional methods. At least 178 individual sharks were identified, and 26 movements were observed. These included movement distances of up to 26.4 km, movement rates of up to 3.27 km/day (9.8 km in 3 days), and movements that required the transit of a 140 m deep channel. Other animals showed high philopatry, being re-sighted at the same locality on multiple occasions (up to 13 sightings for one individual) over periods of up to 7 years. Females showed higher philopatry than males and were more likely than males to be found at shallow ({\textless}10 m depth) localities throughout the year. The proportion of male sightings at shallow localities was significantly higher in April and May than other months of the year, possibly due to males coming into the shallows to mate with females. A peak in sightings of late-term females followed by an abrupt decline suggests that pupping season is May into early June, and two females were observed pregnant in consecutive years despite evidence that the gestation period is approximately 1 year for this species. Nine percent of animals carried fishing tackle or exhibited jaw injuries associated with fishery interactions, with multiple individuals found dead after being hooked by fishers},

Archival tags promise the ability to help uncover long-term movement patterns at the individual level, if the tags can be retained and recovered from healthy fish. We examined fifteen individuals (69–90-�cm fork length) for long-term physiological response to intracoelomic implantation of three types of archival tags: fully internal, internal with right angle protruding light stalk, and internal with straight protruding light stalk. Tags represented 0.05–0.16\% of initial fish weights. Fish were reared at 10.8-�-�-�1.1-�C for 59-�weeks post-surgery. One fish died after 39-�weeks from thermal stress unrelated to the surgical procedure. Temporal variation in behavior of tagged fish was indistinguishable from that of controls (n-�=-�15 tagged, 5 controls). Treatment and control-group fish grew at similar rates. No tag expulsion or physiological response was evident in the individual that died at 39-�weeks, but nine of eleven individuals dissected at the end of 59-�weeks had developed internal responses. These responses ranged from deposition of fibrous protein and/or calcitic material on tag surfaces to partial or full tag encapsulation in either the visceral peritoneal layer (fully-internal tags) or the intestinal mesenteries (stalk-bearing tags). The responses were within the range reported for other pleuronectids implanted with tags of similar configuration and may have implications for design and interpretation of long-term tagging studies. Encapsulation may reduce the probability of tag recoveries even in the absence of tag expulsion, especially in species eviscerated at sea},

	abstract = {This paper presents information on the movements of white sharks, Carcharodon carcharias, at the South Farallon Islands (SFI), central California. Acoustic telemetry techniques provided preliminary data on the diurnal space utilization, movement patterns and swimming depths of four white sharks, ranging from approximately 3.7 to 4.9m in length. Sharks swam within about 10m of the bottom to depths of approximately 30m, but in deeper water they tended to stray more from the bottom. Activity spaces for time periods tracked ranged from 1.84 to 9.15km 2 . Indications are that an inverse relationship exists between length and activity space. During the time tracked, larger individuals swam within particular areas around the islands whereas smaller individuals did not restrict their movements in the same manner. Values of a site attachment index were inversely related to length for all sharks tracked. The site attachment indices, apparent inverse relationship between total length and activity space and observations on telemetered and other known individuals support a hypothesis that larger sharks possess site fidelity in their search for prey at SFI, within and between years. With the high frequency of predation by white sharks on juvenile northern elephant seals at SFI in the fall, the majority of the sharks' movements are probably related to their search for these pinniped prey. These data provide preliminary evidence that white sharks at SFI may search for prey by swimming in a particular area over a number of days or weeks, traversing the area in a manner which maximizes coverage, and swimming close to the bottom or at a distance far enough from the surface to remain cryptic from prey},

Acoustic monitoring data were used to define the residency and movement patterns of sharks within Crooked Island Sound, Florida. Over 3-�years, sharks were monitored for periods of 1–37-�days, with individuals regularly moving in and out of the study site. Individual sharks were continuously present within the study site for periods of 1–35-�days. Patterns of movement could not be correlated with time of day. Home range sizes were typically small (average = 1.29-�km2) and did not vary on a yearly basis. Gillnet sampling revealed that juvenile Atlantic sharpnose sharks were present in all habitat types found within Crooked Island Sound, and peaks in abundance varied depending on month within a year. Although telemetry data showed that most individuals remained within the study site for short periods of time before emigrating, conventional tag–recapture data indicates some individuals return to Crooked Island Sound after extended absences (maximum length = 1,352-�days). Although conventional shark nursery theory suggests small sharks remain in shallow coastal waters to avoid predation, juvenile Atlantic sharpnose sharks frequently exited from protected areas and appear to move through deeper waters to adjacent coastal bays and estuaries. Given the high productivity exhibited by this species, the benefit gained through a nursery that reduces predation may be limited for this species},

	abstract = {We used a combination of satellite telemetry, archival and conventional tags to show that white sharks made broad-scale movements consistent with mixing of the population across their entire Australasian range. The capture of one of these sharks in New Zealand, some 3,550-�km from the point of tagging in South Australia, provides further confirmation that white sharks sometimes move into open ocean waters and cross deep ocean basins. However, most movements were confined to shelf waters, generally in areas of less than 100-�m depth and in some cases into waters of less than 5-�m depth. Sharks showed considerable plasticity in swimming patterns, which included many of the behaviours reported for other species. One of the archival-tagged sharks showed separate periods of distinct swimming behaviour as it moved into different habitats and travelled between them. The changes in swimming behaviour were abrupt and suggested rapid switching of hunting strategies for different prey types in these habitats. All tracked sharks showed both prolonged periods of directional swimming in coastal waters at swimming speeds of 2–3-�km-�h−1 as well as temporary residency in particular regions. Movements of tagged white sharks, together with data from shark control programs and bycatch records, suggest a seasonal movement northward along the east coast of Australia during the autumn–winter months and south in spring–early summer. The consistency of paths taken by white sharks in Australian waters suggests that they may follow common routes or highways in some areas. If so, identifying such areas may assist in reducing interactions with fishing operations and thus reduce bycatch},

Four records of chelonians eaten by white sharks in the Mediterranean Sea are described, which on the basis of carapace remnants confirmed both the loggerhead Caretta caretta and green turtle Chelonia mydas to be preyed upon in those waters. The condition of these remains indicates that large white sharks can ingest turtles essentially intact. As well as falling prey to white sharks, we suspect that some interactions involve turtles being ‘grab-released' in a non-predatory mannner and their survivability from such low-intensity bites or other mouthings may be quite high. The white shark may be the chief marine predator of adult chelonians in the Mediterranean Sea, albeit the impact of this predation upon turtle populations is nominal compared to other sources of mortality. Further, we give an account describing an adult ocean sunfish, Mola mola , in the stomach of a white shark taken in Italian waters},

The primary objective of this project was to investigate the depths and temperatures of the waters occupied by large juvenile sandbar sharks of the northwest Atlantic population during the winter months and the overwintering localities of these animals using a fishery independent method. During the summer of 2003, 21 sandbar sharks captured in the Eastern Shore of Virginia bays and lagoons were outfitted with satellite transmitters that were programmed to detach during the following winter. The sharks occurred in significantly colder and deeper waters during the winter period than during the summer nursery period with a mean depth and temperature recorded by the transmitters during the winter period of 19.9-�C and 20.8-�m and a mean depth and temperature recorded during the summer period of 24.0-�C and 4.3-�m. Despite this decrease in temperature and increase in depth of occurrence, the sharks remained in relatively warm waters and shallow depths throughout the overwintering period. Satellite pop-off locations during the overwintering period were concentrated in central North Carolina coastal waters, where a unique combination of shallow depths and warm temperatures may contribute to the survivorship of these animals while they overwinter in these waters},

Serum titers of 17+�-estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, and 5+�-dihydrotestosterone were determined via radioimmunoassay in adult male sharks from 1988 to 2000. Sampling overlap between the two institutions occurred for 3 months of the year, but steroid concentrations were compared only for April due to the occurrence of sexual conflicts in the sharks at the National Aquarium in Baltimore in that month. For April, testosterone and dihydrotestosterone were significantly higher in the SeaWorld males, and progesterone was significantly higher in the National Aquarium in Baltimore males, while estradiol was not significantly different. Steroid levels were also determined from serial samples taken monthly over 17 months from three male sharks and one female shark at the National Aquarium in Baltimore in 2001–2002 and were compared with corresponding observed sexual conflicts. The steroid levels obtained showed distinct annual hormonal cycles in the male sharks and corroborated a biennial cycle for the single serially-sampled female shark. Furthermore, the steroid levels for individual males correlated with sexual conflicts as well as their position within the male dominance hierarchy. As this species is depleted in some regions globally, insight into the steroid profile of mature sand tiger sharks is important for a greater understanding of the relationship between their reproductive physiology and behavior, and may aid in captive management and reproduction},

Veterinarians and fish researchers bring different strengths and deficits to bear in a fish surgery project, and it is helpful to recognize these for successful collaborations.

The dynamic nature of the fishing requires underwater filming techniques that can move with the fishing activity and capture high-resolution footage enabling the identification of fauna species. In the case of shark depredation, the development of deterrent devices specifically designed for use while line fishing will require underwater footage to determine the effectiveness of those devices designed to invoke avoidance behaviours in sharks that approach hooked fish. Two new and inexpensive mounting systems were developed, enabling a range of “action” cameras to be attached to fishing lines to capture underwater footage while line fishing. Using these mounting systems with GoProTM cameras, high-resolution video was obtained during line fishing trials in which the effectiveness of shark deterrents was investigated. The video footage enabled the identification of fish and shark species and recorded any avoidance behaviours of sharks, in response to the presence of deterrents.},

	abstract = {Shark encounters while fishing in Western Australian waters have been perceived to be increasing by some fishers in recent years. A lack of quantitative information remains a significant obstacle to determining the nature and magnitude of these encounters. A probability-based survey was implemented to assess the occurrence of and attitudes toward shark encounters by commercial fishers, charter tour operators and private boat-based recreational fishers during 2015/16. Of the 906 fishers interviewed, 52\% indicated they had experienced at least one shark encounter while fishing during the previous year. The loss or damage of fish was involved in over half of these encounters while charter fishing and nearly a third while recreational fishing. The level of concern towards shark depredation was highest among charter tour operators state-wide and all sectors in the Gascoyne bioregion. Multiple logistic regression analyses indicated fishing method and bioregion were the most important predictors of encounters. Depredation through fish loss below or at the surface was highest for pelagic or demersal line fishing in the North Coast and Gascoyne bioregions. Overwhelmingly, the majority of fishers in all sectors were satisfied with their fishing experience despite the occurrence of shark encounters. Future research on shark depredation would benefit from focusing on fishing methods and bioregions where depredation events were highest, with consideration of associated behavioural and environmental characteristics likely to influence depredation rates. The approach outlined here could easily be applied to other human-wildlife interaction studies where representative views of stakeholders are required for policy development and effective management.},

Given the growth in consumption of seafood, combined with the compounding effects of habitat loss, climate change, and pollution, there is a need to identify recovery paths, particularly in poorly managed and poorly monitored fisheries. Here, we document conservation through fisheries management success for 11 coastal sharks in US waters by comparing population trends through a Bayesian state-space model before and after the implementation of the 1993 Fisheries Management Plan for Sharks. We took advantage of the spatial and temporal gradients in fishing exposure and fisheries management in the Western Atlantic to analyze the effect on the Red List status of all 26 wide-ranging coastal sharks and rays. We show that extinction risk was greater where fishing pressure was higher, but this was offset by the strength of management engagement (indicated by strength of National and Regional Plan of Action for sharks and rays). The regional Red List Index (which tracks changes in extinction risk through time) declined in all regions until the 1980s but then improved in the North and Central Atlantic such that the average extinction risk is currently half that in the Southwest. Many sharks and rays are wide ranging, and successful fisheries management in one country can be undone by poorly regulated or unregulated fishing elsewhere. Our study underscores that well-enforced, science-based management of carefully monitored fisheries can achieve conservation success, even for slow-growing species.},

	abstract = {Western Australia (WA) is host to a genetically discrete population of grey nurse sharks Carcharias taurus, listed by the IUCN as Near Threatened based on mean annual catch rates prior to protection within Australian waters in 1997. Only one small aggregation has been documented in WA to date with little data available on population dynamics, or spatial and temporal distribution along the WA coastline. We analysed C. taurus data from 16 years (2006−2021) of diver observations (2347 sightings) and commercial fisheries bycatch records (574 sharks), finding evidence of 4 new aggregation sites. Sightings at Shark Cave, a popular dive site near Perth, were related to water temperature and time of year (non-linear), with sightings per unit effort generally higher during the warmer months of summer and autumn (20−22°C). Evidence of fishing injuries was found on 17\% of all C. taurus photo-tagged at Shark Cave. Strong site philopatry was apparent at most sites, and included a male shark that returned for 12 consecutive years to the Exmouth Navy Pier. This study confirms the range of Australia’s western population of C. taurus from near the South Australia/WA border, north to Shark Bay, with distribution extending further north along the coast when sea temperatures are lower (May−December). The beneficial role of citizen science in large observation studies such as this one is supported. However, while this research greatly increases the C. taurus knowledge base in WA, a large information deficit still exists. The identification and assessment of further aggregation sites is recommended, underpinning future management and protection measures for this iconic species.},

	abstract = {The Brownie models for multiyear tagging studies can be used to estimate age- and year-specific annual survival rates and tag recovery rates. The latter are composites of the exploitation rates and rates of tag reporting, tag shedding, and tag-induced mortality. It is possible to estimate the exploitation rates if the other components of the tag recovery rates can be quantified. Instantaneous rates of fishing and natural mortality can be estimated if information is available on the seasonal distribution of fishing effort. The estimated rates are only moderately dependent on the timing of the fishing; consequently, the relative effort data can be crude. Information on the timing of the catch over the course of the year can be used as a substitute for the effort data. Fishing mortality can also be assumed to be proportional to fishing effort over years; consequently, if fishing effort is known then the tag reporting rate, natural mortality rate, and a single catchability coefficient can be estimated (instead of natural mortality and a series of fishing mortalities). Although it is possible in theory to estimate both the tag reporting rate and the natural mortality rate with all of these models, in practice it appears necessary to obtain some additional data relating to tag reporting rate to obtain acceptable results. The additional data can come from a variable reward tagging study, a creel or port sampling survey, or from tagged animals that are secretly added to the fishers’ catches.},

	abstract = {An Ecological Risk Assessment (ERA; also known as Productivity and Susceptibility Analysis, PSA) was conducted on sixteen species (15 sharks and 1 ray) or 20 stocks of pelagic elasmobranchs to assess their vulnerability to pelagic longline fisheries in the Atlantic Ocean. This was a quantitative assessment consisting of a risk analysis to evaluate the biological productivity of these stocks and a susceptibility analysis to assess their propensity to capture and mortality in pelagic longline fisheries. The risk analysis estimated productivity (maximum rate of increase, r) using a stochastic life table/Leslie matrix approach that incorporated uncertainty in age at maturity, lifespan, and both age-specific natural mortality and fecundity. Susceptibility to the fishery was calculated as the product of four components, which were also computed quantitatively: availability of the species to the fleet, encounterability of the gear given the species vertical distribution, gear selectivity, and post-capture mortality. Information from observer programs by ten ICCAT nations was used to derive fleet-specific susceptibility values. Three metrics were used to calculate vulnerability (Euclidean distance, a multiplicative index, and the arithmetic mean of the productivity and susceptibility ranks). The five stocks with the lowest productivity were the bigeye thresher (Alopias superciliosus), sandbar (Carcharhinus plumbeus), longfin mako (Isurus paucus), night (Carcharhinus signatus), and South Atlantic silky shark (Carcharhinus falciformis). The highest susceptibility values corresponded to shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus), North and South Atlantic blue sharks (Prionace glauca), porbeagle (Lamna nasus), and bigeye thresher. Based on the arithmetic mean vulnerability index, which did not show preferential correlation with the productivity or susceptibility indices, the bigeye thresher, longfin and shortfin makos, porbeagle, and night sharks were the most vulnerable stocks. In contrast, North and South Atlantic scalloped hammerheads (Sphyrna lewini), smooth hammerhead (Sphyrna zygaena), and North and South Atlantic pelagic stingray (Pteroplatytrygon violacea) had the lowest vulnerabilities.},

Here, we describe one widely used tool that has proven successful in increasing the efficiency of the assessment process: the r4ss package, which supports the use of the Stock Synthesis modeling framework. What began 15 years ago as a tool to provide simple model diagnostics, including plots showing data and model results, has grown into a large collection of R functions to support many aspects of the assessment process. We provide an overview of the r4ss features and illustrate its utility with examples from recent applications. Finally, we discuss lessons learned from the ongoing development of r4ss that can be applied to similar efforts associated with the next generation of stock assessment packages.},

Stock as­ sessments that include this parameter often show great sensitivity to its value, reflecting the need to characetrize the uncertainty inherent in its estimation. Direct measurement of natural mortality is often limited to resource intensive tag-recapture studies. Indirect measures are more often used, and are built on life history theory, relating natural mortality to traits such as age, size, maturity and reproductive condition (or just assuming 0.2). The Natural Mortality Tool attempts to accumulate several empirical estimators of M into one application. Users simply input life history values to obtain estimates of natural mortality. These estimates can be taken individ­ ually or can be combined into a weighted density function that can be used to develop an M prior that integrates uncertainty across several estimates. Comparing estimators can also reveal inconsistencies in life history values that may lead to further refining of basic biological understanding. Two examples are used to demonstrate tool functionality and highlight general recommendations on implementation. Making these estimators and the development of uncertainty in estimating natural mortality more widely available hopefully supports transparent and defensible decision-making on the treatment of this important population parameter.},

Therefore, M is often estimated indirectly from life history traits, and it is typically assumed to be invariant over size, age, and time. Such indirect estimators are particularly relevant for data-poor species, including many elasmobranchs (sharks, skates, and rays). However, as commonly used estimators were developed largely with teleost (bony fish) data, their performance for elasmobranchs is currently unknown. Here, we show that the relationship between observed maximum age, tmax, and mean adult M is not significantly different between teleosts (n = 105) and elasmobranchs (n = 15). Furthermore, data on 16 teleosts and 2 elasmobranchs suggest that juvenile M can be estimated from adult M when juvenile M is inversely proportional to body length and when a reference length can be provided. We introduce this reference length as the length at the age after which M is assumed to be constant and demonstrate how it can be estimated using the von Bertalanffy growth function and the proportion surviving to tmax, which is shown to be approximately 1−2\%. The data utilized here also suggest that if tmax is unknown it can be estimated from growth information by assuming that 99\% of the asymptotic maximum length is reached at tmax. Based on these life history parameters, the same indirect M estimators can be utilized for teleosts and elasmobranchs, which may contribute to more reliable assessments of data-poor species.},

Meta-analytical approaches relating M to other life history parameters are often used to provide an estimate and/or Bayesian prior for M. Longevity is the one of these life history parameters most directly related to M. The maximum observed or estimated age serves as a proxy for longevity in predicting, or developing a prior for, M to be used within a stock assessment or other population model. Consideration of the age data and factors that might influence its quality for deter­ mining a maximum age is important in using a meta-analytically derived relationship between maximum age and M, though these factors are not completely absent from the data used to develop that relationship. Here, we discuss these issues, propose a relationship between maximum age and M, and develop an updated prior for M based upon maximum age.},

	abstract = {Natural mortality (M) is one of the most influential parameters in fisheries stock assessment and management. It relates directly to stock productivity and reference points used for fisheries management advice. Unfortunately, M is also very difficult to estimate, and hence very uncertain. Representing the uncertainty in M and how this influences estimates of management quantities is therefore an important component of conducting stock as­ sessments. This paper outlines the range of methods available to estimate M for use in stock assessment. The methods include those based on maximum age, life history theory, relationships between “well-known” values for M (those found in the literature and based on data for the stock being assessed) and covariates, use of tagging data and catch curve analysis, and estimation within a single- or multi-species stock assessment model. All methods are likely subject to bias and imprecision due to incorrect assumptions and incomplete data. Further­ more, M is generally assumed to be constant over time, age, and sex - assumptions that are unlikely to be true for any stock. Based on our review, there is an obvious benefit to directly estimating M using data and within a stock assessment while assigning a prior based on empirical methods. This approach effectively uses all the available information while also representing the uncertainty. Carefully examining diagnostics and checking for model misspecification is required to ensure that the available data and stock assessment model assumptions are appropriately informative about M when it is estimated during the model fitting process. For situations where direct estimation is not possible (a condition found in data-limited to data-rich stock assessments), the use of multiple methods with robust sensitivity exploration is recommended. Even when direct data are integrated into a stock assessment, we recommend using other methods to estimate M and analysing the direct data outside the stock assessment model as diagnostic tools.},

	abstract = {Sharks and rays evolved 450 million years ago, during the Late Ordovician Period. However, during the modern Anthropocene, shark populations have declined at considerable rates, and recent global assessments indicate about one in three species is threatened with extinction. A notable reason for this elevated extinction risk is overfishing linked to increased demand for shark fins and other products. Here, we review multiple dimensions of consuming shark products, ranging from stock sustainability, product (mis)labelling and trade, the human health implications of consuming shark products, and illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and slavery and labour abuses in the fishing industry. We conclude that traceability and increased transparency in seafood supply chains is essential to overcome obstacles to consumption of sustainable, ethical and healthy shark products. We also provide a decision tree outlining steps in consumer choice that would foster such consumption. Our aim is to provide a holistic view on issues concerning the consumption of shark products that will help policymakers, the public, management and law enforcement agencies to advocate for ecologically-­and ethically sustainable consumption of shark products and thereby empower the general public to make informed decisions on which shark products they consume.},

	abstract = {Machine-assisted object detection and classification of fish species from Baited Remote Underwater Video Station (BRUVS) surveys using deep learning algorithms presents an opportunity for optimising analysis time and rapid reporting of marine ecosystem statuses. Training object detection algorithms for BRUVS analysis presents significant challenges: the model requires training datasets with bounding boxes already applied identifying the location of all fish individuals in a scene, and it requires training datasets identifying species with labels. In both cases, substantial volumes of data are required and this is currently a manual, labour-intensive process, resulting in a paucity of the labelled data currently required for training object detection models for species detection. Here, we present a “machine-assisted” approach for i) a generalised model to automate the application of bounding boxes to any underwater environment containing fish and ii) fish detection and classification to species identification level, up to 12 target species. A catch-all “fish” classification is applied to fish individuals that remain unidentified due to a lack of available training and validation data. Machine-assisted bounding box annotation was shown to detect and label fish on out-of-sample datasets with a recall between 0.70 and 0.89 and automated labelling of 12 targeted species with an F1 score of 0.79. On average, 12\% of fish were given a bounding box with species labels and 88\% of fish were located and given a fish label and identified for manual labelling. Taking a combined, machine-assisted approach presents a significant advancement towards the applied use of deep learning for fish species detection in fish analysis and workflows and has potential for future fish ecologist uptake if integrated into video analysis software. Manual labelling and classification effort is still required, and a community effort to address the limitation presented by a severe paucity of training data would improve automation accuracy and encourage increased uptake.},

The flexibility of integrated analysis models allows them to be applied over extended time periods spanning historical decades with little information from which to estimate the annual signal of recruitment variability to modern periods in which more information about recruitment variability exists. Across this range of data availability, the estimation process must assure that the estimated log-normally distributed recruitments are mean unbiased to assure mean unbiased biomass estimates. Here we show how the estimation method implemented in the integrated analysis model, Stock Synthesis, achieves this unbiased characteristic in a penalized likelihood approach that is comparable to the results from Markov chain Monte Carlo. The total variability in recruitment is decomposed into variability among annual recruitment estimates based on information in the data and a residual variability. Because data are never perfectly informative, we show that estimated recruitment variability will always be less than the true variability among recruitments and that the method implemented here can be used to iteratively estimate the true variability among recruitments.},

	abstract = {Understanding patterns of connectivity in exploited elasmobranchs is vital to their successful management and ongoing sustainability. In this study we use 1480 nuclear SNP loci to investigate fine-scale genetic connectivity in sandbar sharks (Carcharhinus plumbeus) along the Western Australian coastline into the Timor Sea with high statistical power. The genetic dataset was combined with latitudinal and depth size distribution data to increase our understanding of population structuring of this species along the continuous Western Australian coastline. Genetic analyses based on traditional and Bayesian approaches found no evidence of restrictions to nuclear gene flow in sandbar sharks between Albany on the south coast and the Timor Sea to the north. The size distributions reveal a size-segregated population, with juveniles predominantly found in deeper water in the south of the state, and adults predominantly in shallower northern waters. The combination of these genomic and size datasets indicates that sandbar sharks form a single population within Western Australia. Levels of genetic diversity, e.g. observed and expected heterozygosity and allelic richness, in this population were high, implying that the size of the population is relatively large. The results have important management implications; despite forming a single biological stock, the species’ size segregation highlights the importance of ongoing management to minimize the likelihood of growth overfishing in the south of the state. Also, the stock extends into the Timor Sea where unmanaged Indonesian fishing may impact sustainability in Western Australian waters.},

	abstract = {Integrated analysis has increasingly been the preferred approach for conducting stock assessments and providing the basis for management advice for fish and invertebrate stocks around the world. Many decisions are required when developing integrated stock assessments. For example, the analyst needs to decide whether the model fits the data, if the optimization was successful, if estimates are consistent retrospectively, and if the model is suitable to predict future stock responses to fishing. This study provides practical guidelines for implementing selected diagnostic tools that can assist analysts in identifying problems with model specifications and alternatives that can be explored to minimize or eliminate such problems. Emphasis is placed on reviewing the implementation and interpretation of contemporary model diagnostic tools. We first describe each diagnostic approach and its utility. We then proceed by providing a “cookbook recipe” on how to implement each of the diagnostics, together with an interpretation of the results, using two worked examples of integrated stock assessments with Stock Synthesis. Further, we provide a conceptual flow chart that lays out a generic process of model development and selection using the presented model diagnostics. Based on this, we propose the following four properties as objective criteria for evaluating the plausibility of a model: (1) model convergence, (2) fit to the data, (3) model consistency, and (4) prediction skill. It would greatly benefit the stock assessment community if the next gen­ eration of stock assessment models could include the diagnostic tests presented in this study as a set of open source tools.},

This work uses productivity–susceptibility analysis (PSA) to measure the vulnerabilities of 90 managed groundﬁsh stocks, 64 of which are currently managed within stock complexes. These stock complexes are reevaluated by ﬁrst using a partitioning cluster analysis to group the stocks by depth and latitude. Vulnerability reference points are then established based on the PSA results to determine vulnerability groups of low, medium, high, and major concern within each ecological group. This method is a simple and ﬂexible approach to incorporating vulnerability measures into stock complex designations while providing information with which to prioritize stockand complex-speciﬁc management.},

            Seafood mislabelling and species substitution, compounded by a convoluted seafood supply chain with significant traceability challenges, hinder efforts towards more sustainable, responsible, and ethical fishing and business practices. We conducted the largest evaluation of the quality and accuracy of labels for 672 seafood products sold in Australia, assessing six seafood groups (i.e., hoki, prawns, sharks and rays, snapper, squid and cuttlefish, and tuna) from fishmongers, restaurants, and supermarkets, including domestically caught and imported products. DNA barcoding revealed 11.8\% of seafood tested did not match their label with sharks and rays, and snappers, having the highest mislabelling rate. Moreover, only 25.5\% of products were labelled at a species-level, while most labels used vague common names or umbrella terms such as ‘flake’ and ‘snapper’. These poor-quality labels had higher rates of mislabelling than species-specific labels and concealed the sale of threatened or overfished taxa, as well as products with lower nutritional quality, reduced economic value, or potential health risks. Our results highlight Australia’s weak seafood labelling regulations and ambiguous non-mandatory naming conventions, which impede consumer choice for accurately represented, sustainable, and responsibly sourced seafood. We recommend strengthening labelling regulations to mitigate seafood mislabelling and substitution, ultimately improving consumer confidence when purchasing seafood.},

	abstract = {Spatial stock assessments have been developed to address violations of the dynamic pool assumption that the region to be assessed contains a single homogeneous stock. The possibility of such violation is often evident in data that suggest different trends in abundance or catch / survey age- / size-structure among areas that cannot be explained simply by the fishing history among areas. Currently, most stock assessments account for spatial structure using the ‘areas-as-fleets’ approach in which fishery or survey selectivity and catchability are assumed to differ spatially. However, several simulation studies suggest that adopting spatial approaches to stock assessment will improve estimation performance compared to the areas-as-fleets approach or ignoring spatial structure when conducting stock assessments, although at the cost of a larger number of estimable parameters. Spatial approaches to stock assessment and the provision of management advice have been available since the 1950s. However, spatial stock assessments only became adopted for management purposes in the 1990s, with the widespread adoption of the “integrated approach” to stock assessment, which allowed the use of multiple data sets for parameter estimation. The number of spatial stock assessments is now increasing rapidly. This paper outlines some of the key decisions that need to be made when conducting a spatial stock assessment (number of areas, how to model recruitment, movement, growth and dispersal, and model parameterization).},

Overall, 18 shark and ray taxonomic groups were discarded, comprising ,20\% of the observed catch by number. Port Jackson shark, southern eagle ray and spurdogs were the most commonly discarded elasmobranchs, followed by western wobbegong, angel sharks, stingrays, and guitarfish and shovelnose rays. For the base case scenario, the catch of these species was small, peaking at 12.6, 5.6, 1.3, 1.8, 4, 1.3 and 2.7 tonnes (Mg) respectively, given their low post-release mortality (PRM). Current catch levels were even lower (e.g. ,5 Mg for Port Jackson shark). Other discarded elasmobranchs were rarely caught. Assuming 100\% PRM resulted in higher annual catches, highlighting the need for further research on the PRM of sharks and rays.

In Australia, consumers mainly purchase shark products from retail outlets called fish and chip shops. Accurate and precise labelling of shark products is essential to ensure that consumers can make informed choices about the types of shark products they consume. However, little is known about labelling practices in fish and chip shops. We conducted a review of online menus to assess the quality of labelling of shark products in fish and chip shops across Australia. Using a Google search, we identified 1132 fish and chip shops and found that most had online menus (n = 850, 75\% of 1132). Over half of the menus included shark products (n = 435, 51\% of 850) with another 277 (33\% of 850) selling unspecified ‘fish and chips’ products that could include shark and 138 (16\% of 850) selling specific ‘scalefish’ products. Of those menus (712 of 850) that either offered shark products or products that could include shark meat, most were labelled using generic terms such as ’flake’ (37\%, 261 of 712) or unspecified ’shark’ (9\%, 64 of 712) and unspecified ‘fish and chips’ (38\%, 275 of 712). Only 16\% (111 of 712) of retail outlets provided shark species-specific labels and only 41\% of these also provided information about the area of origin, which was typically expressed as either ‘Australian/Local’ or ‘Imported’. We argue that relevant authorities should focus on policies aimed at improving labelling practices, including a requirement for menus to incorporate authentic species name and area of origin information, as this has the potential to enable consumers to purchase products obtained from sustainable shark fishing, and would reward retailers who use informative product labels.},

Alternative choices can substantially change the index, and hence stock assess­ ment outcomes and management decisions. To guide decisions, we provide advice on good practices in 16 areas, focusing on decision points: fishery definitions, exploring and preparing data, misreporting, data aggregation, density and catchability covariates, environmental variables, combining CPUE and survey data, analysis tools, spatial considerations, setting up and predicting from the model, uncertainty estimation, error distributions, model diagnostics, model selection, multispecies targeting, and using CPUE in stock assessments. Often the most influential outcome of exploring and analysing catch and effort data is that analysts better understand the population and the fishery, thereby improving the stock assessment.},

The results are compared with the traditional GLMs currently used in ETBF assessments as well as GAMs. Speciﬁcally, we compare seven models in three groups: two GLMs, two GAMs, and three GRF models. Within each group, one model treats spatial and temporal variables independently, while the other model(s) treats them together as an interaction term. The two spatio-temporal GRF models differ in treating the spatial–temporal interaction: either as a random process or as an autoregressive process. We simulate catch rate data for ﬁve pelagic species based on real ﬁshery catch rates so that the simulated data reﬂect real ﬁshery patterns while the “true” annual abundance levels are known. The results show that within each group, the model with a spatial–temporal interaction term signiﬁcantly outperforms the other model treating spatial and temporal variables independently. For spatial–temporal models between the three groups, prediction accuracy tends to improve from GLM to GAM and to the GRF models. Overall, the spatio-temporal GRF autoregressive model reduces mean relative predictive error by 43.4\% from the GLM, 33.9\% from the GAM, and reduces mean absolute predictive error by 23.5\% from the GLM and 3.3\% from the GAM, respectively.

	abstract = {Assessing the health of fish populations relies on determining the length of fish in sample species subsets, in conjunction with other key ecosystem markers; thereby, inferring overall health of communities. Despite attempts to use artificial intelligence (AI) to measure fish, most measurement remains a manual process, often necessitating fish being removed from the water. Overcoming this limitation and potentially harmful intervention by measuring fish without disturbance in their natural habitat would greatly enhance and expedite the process. Stereo baited remote underwater video systems (stereo-BRUVS) are widely used as a non-invasive, stressless method for manually counting and measuring fish in aquaculture, fisheries and conservation management. However, the application of deep learning (DL) to stereo-BRUVS image processing is showing encouraging progress towards replacing the manual and labour-intensive task of precisely locating the heads and tails of fish with computer-vision-based algorithms. Here, we present a generalised, semi-automated method for measuring the length of fish using DL with near-human accuracy for numerous species of fish. Additionally, we combine the DL method with a highly precise stereo-BRUVS calibration method, which uses calibration cubes to ensure precision within a few millimetres in calculated lengths. In a human versus DL comparison of accuracy, we show that, although DL commonly slightly over-estimates or under-estimates length, with enough repeated measurements, the two values average and converge to the same length, demonstrated by a Pearson correlation coefficient (r) of 0.99 for n=3954 measurement in ‘out-of-sample’ test data. We demonstrate, through the inclusion of visual examples of stereo-BRUVS scenes, the accuracy of this approach. The head-to-tail measurement method presented here builds on, and advances, previously published object detection for stereo-BRUVS. Furthermore, by replacing the manual process of four careful mouse clicks on the screen to precisely locate the head and tail of a fish in two images, with two fast clicks anywhere on that fish in those two images, a significant reduction in image processing and analysis time is expected. By reducing analysis times, more images can be processed; thereby, increasing the amount of data available for environmental reporting and decision making.},

	abstract = {An Integrated Risk Assessment for Climate Change (IRACC) is developed and applied to assess the vulnerability of sharks and rays on Australia’s Great Barrier Reef (GBR) to climate change. The IRACC merges a traditional climate change vulnerability framework with approaches from ﬁsheries ecological risk assessments. This semi-quantitative assessment accommodates uncertainty and can be applied at different spatial and temporal scales to identify exposure factors, at-risk species and their key biological and ecological attributes, critical habitats a‘nd ecological processes, and major knowledge gaps. Consequently, the IRACC can provide a foundation upon which to develop climate change response strategies. Here, we describe the assessment process, demonstrate its application to GBR shark and ray species, and explore the issues affecting their vulnerability to climate change. The assessment indicates that for the GBR, freshwater/estuarine and reef associated sharks and rays are most vulnerable to climate change, and that vulnerability is driven by case-speciﬁc interactions of multiple factors and species attributes. Changes in temperature, freshwater input and ocean circulation will have the most widespread effects on these species. Although relatively few GBR sharks and rays were assessed as highly vulnerable, their vulnerability increases when synergies with other factors are considered. This is especially true for freshwater/estuarine and coastal/inshore sharks and rays. Reducing the impacts of climate change on the GBR’s sharks and rays requires a range of approaches including mitigating climate change and addressing habitat degradation and sustainability issues. Species-speciﬁc conservation actions may be required for higher risk species (e.g. the freshwater whipray, porcupine ray, speartooth shark and sawﬁshes) including reducing mortality, preserving coastal catchments and estuarine habitats, and addressing ﬁsheries sustainability. The assessment identiﬁed many knowledge gaps concerning GBR habitats and processes, and highlights the need for improved understanding of the biology and ecology of the sharks and rays of the GBR.},

Key results. Of 57 individuals examined, there was 100\% post-capture survival after a maximum of 4 h on the hook. Most of these animals (88\%) displayed a strong release condition, exhibiting minimal behavioural impairment. All 13 satellitetagged individuals survived 30 days post-capture. Sharks dived up to 307 m deep and showed cyclical depth movement patterns, with some individuals moving through the water column both day and night, whereas others moved almost exclusively at night. The concentration of blood metabolites did not signiﬁcantly change with time-on-hook. Conclusion. Post-capture and postrelease survival of 100\% after up to 4 h on hooks suggested that the use of longlines for surveying sandbar shark abundance had no deleterious effects on captured sharks. Implication. This will support future stock assessments of sharks by quantifying the survival rates in the methods used for long-term monitoring of sandbar shark populations.},

            Elasmobranchs (sharks, rays and skates) are among the most threatened marine vertebrates, yet their global functional diversity remains largely unknown. Here, we use a trait dataset of {\textgreater}1000 species to assess elasmobranch functional diversity and compare it against other previously studied biodiversity facets (taxonomic and phylogenetic), to identify species- and spatial- conservation priorities. We show that threatened species encompass the full extent of functional space and disproportionately include functionally distinct species. Applying the conservation metric FUSE (Functionally Unique, Specialised, and Endangered) reveals that most top-ranking species differ from the top Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered (EDGE) list. Spatial analyses further show that elasmobranch functional richness is concentrated along continental shelves and around oceanic islands, with 18 distinguishable hotspots. These hotspots only marginally overlap with those of other biodiversity facets, reflecting a distinct spatial fingerprint of functional diversity. Elasmobranch biodiversity facets converge with fishing pressure along the coast of China, which emerges as a critical frontier in conservation. Meanwhile, several components of elasmobranch functional diversity fall in high seas and/or outside the global network of marine protected areas. Overall, our results highlight acute vulnerability of the world’s elasmobranchs’ functional diversity and reveal global priorities for elasmobranch functional biodiversity previously overlooked.},

              One-third of all elasmobranchs (sharks and rays) are threatened with extinction. Euryhaline and estuarine generalist elasmobranchs are a group of 29 species that occupy non-marine environments during particular life-stages. These species are poorly known and disproportionately threatened, with 72.4\% at risk of extinction or Data Deficient. A detailed knowledge of a species’ life history characteristics, movement ecology, habitat use, and population structure are required for the implementation of appropriate management and conservation measures. To date, research on euryhaline and estuarine species has lagged behind marine species. Here, a literature review and gap analysis of the euryhaline and estuarine species was conducted to identify gaps in 14 key parameters required for management. Of the 29 species, only the Bull Shark (
              Carcharhinus leucas
              ) and the Largetooth Sawfish (
              Pristis pristis

              Rhynchobatus springeri
              ) lacks information on all but one of the parameters investigated. There is a high level of understanding of age- and size-at-maturity, size-at-birth, and growth for only five species, while nine species have estimates of natural mortality. Comprehensive reproductive biology data is unavailable for six species. Both short- and long-term movement ecology is well-understood for only two species, and habitat use for six species. Population structure has been studied in only eight species. Data on key life history parameters, population structure, and habitat requirements of the euryhaline and estuarine elasmobranchs are urgently required to develop appropriate management strategies and to secure populations.},

              Rhino rays (Order Rhinopristiformes) are one of the most threatened vertebrate groups. Despite overfishing being recognised as the greatest threat to this group, a comprehensive assessment of the fisheries and types of fishing gear that rhino rays interact with is lacking. We reviewed published and grey literature (
              n
               = 116 references) to evaluate interactions between rhino rays and fisheries, determine gear types most responsible for their capture, and species for which most interactions occur by region. Interactions (
              n
               = 420) were reported from 37 of 88 range states, for 52 of 68 known species. Combined, 59\% of the literature reported interactions from trawlers and gillnets. Wedgefishes (Rhinidae) were the most reported family (29\%) and bowmouth guitarfish (
              Rhina ancylostomus
              ) the most reported species (9.5\%). Asia accounted for half of interactions (
              n
               = 211), with 67\% of the literature from unspecified gear (e.g., mixed landings), masking gear-specific interactions. Data quality was variable, with the highest resolution in countries with lower species diversity and where species are least imperiled (e.g., Australia). Discard mortality and physiological effects of capture are poorly known with data available for 25\% of species (almost exclusively from Australia and the Americas). While additional data are urgently required to quantify the true extent of rhino ray catch globally, reducing fisheries mortality is a priority and key to address declining populations. Recommendations include prioritizing spatial management in critical habitats (e.g., nursery areas), expansion in the use of proven bycatch reduction devices, encouraging safe release and handling, and addressing drivers of retention and trade.},

	abstract = {Over the past two decades, sharks have been increasingly recognized among the world’s most threatened wildlife and hence have received heightened scientific and regulatory scrutiny. Yet, the effect of protective regulations on shark fishing mortality has not been evaluated at a global scale. Here we estimate that total fishing mortality increased from at least 76 to 80 million sharks between 2012 and 2019, {\textasciitilde}25 million of which were threatened species. Mortality increased by 4\% in coastal waters but decreased by 7\% in pelagic fisheries, especially across the Atlantic and Western Pacific. By linking fishing mortality data to the global regulatory landscape, we show that widespread legislation designed to prevent shark finning did not reduce mortality but that regional shark fishing or retention bans had some success. These analyses, combined with expert interviews, highlight evidence-based solutions to reverse the continued overexploitation of sharks.

There are conservation concerns for this species due to ﬁsheries exploitation, low productivity, anthropogenic disturbance at nursery sites, and the depleted status of other large coastal sharks, but no quantitative assessment of Lemon Shark stock status is available. We synthesized available data to develop a stock assessment of the Lemon Shark in the western North Atlantic. All information on stock identity was considered to deﬁne a ﬁshery management unit off the southeastern United States. Stock abundance and trends in ﬁshing mortality were estimated from 1981 to 2017 using a Bayesian state–space surplus production model. The model incorporated prior knowledge of Lemon Shark demography, catches, and a combination of 11 indices of abundance. Seven model conﬁgurations that ﬁt the data well and produced plausible estimates were used to evaluate the sensitivity of posterior estimates to assumed priors and data decisions. Results suggested that Lemon Shark stock abundance has been relatively stable since the mid-1990s, with some estimates of prior depletion. Estimates of relative ﬁshing mortality indicate earlier periods of overﬁshing, with a decrease in ﬁshing mortality since the early 2000s. These estimates of population trends provide information for future ﬁsheries management and conservation.},

This study examined 17 years of logbook bycatch records (n = 815) for green sawfish Pristis zijsron and narrow sawfish Anoxypristis cuspidata from a trawl fishery operating on the Australian North West Shelf. Incidental sawfish captures by the fishery are rare, occurring approximately once every 75 trawls ({\textasciitilde}199 trawl hours). To standardize catch rates and account for excess zeros in the data, we employed generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSSs) using a zero-inflated Poisson distribution. For green sawfish, catch rates approximately doubled over the study period, while an oscillating trend was observed for narrow sawfish catch rates. Reported captures occurred throughout the management boundaries of the fishery, which operates in mid-shelf waters from 48 to 121 m. A weak seasonal signal in catch rates was detected for both species, with the highest capture numbers occurring during autumn–winter, consistent with an expected inshore migration for parturition during spring–summer. Logbook trends were partly corroborated by independently verified data collected in a subset of years, which also showed an increasing proportion of green sawfish in the catch. Our findings emphasize the importance of sawfish populations in northwestern Australia within the context of global conservation efforts for this taxon.},

The seamounts along the Cocos Ridge in the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) ocean are thought to be ecologically important aggregation sites for LPS when moving between Cocos Island (Costa Rica) and Galapagos Islands (Ecuador). However, to date, research efforts to quantify the abundance and distribution patterns of LPS beyond the borders of these two oceanic Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have been limited. This study used drifting-pelagic baited remote underwater video stations (BRUVS) to investigate the distribution and relative abundance of LPS at Cocos Ridge seamounts. Our drifting-pelagic BRUVS recorded a total of 21 species including elasmobranchs, small and large teleosts, dolphins and one sea turtle; of which four species are currently threatened. Depth of seamount summit was the most significant driver for LPS richness and abundance which were significantly higher at shallow seamounts ({\textless} 400 m) compared to deeper ones ({\textgreater} 400m). Distance to nearest MPA was also a significant predictor for LPS abundance, which increased at increasing distances from the nearest MPA. Our results suggest that the Cocos Ridge seamounts, specifically Paramount and West Cocos which had the highest LPS richness and abundance, are important aggregation sites for LPS in the ETP. However, further research is still needed to demonstrate a positive association between LPS and Cocos Ridge seamounts. Our findings showed that drifting pelagic BRUVS are an effective tool to survey LPS in fully pelagic ecosystems of the ETP. This study represents the first step towards the standardization of this technique throughout the region.},

However, implementation is perceived as challenging and often slow. A poll of over 150 international EBM experts revealed progress, challenges, and solutions in EBM implementation worldwide. Subsequent follow-up discussions with over 40 of these experts identified remaining impediments to further implementation of EBM: governance; stakeholder engagement; support; uncertainty about and understanding of EBM; technology and data; communication and marketing. EBM is often portrayed as too complex or too challenging to be fully implemented, but we report that identifiable and achievable solutions exist (e.g., political will, persistence, capacity building, changing incentives, and strategic marketing of EBM), for most of these challenges and some solutions can solve many impediments simultaneously. Furthermore, we are advancing in key components of EBM by practitioners who may not necessarily realize they are doing so under different paradigms. These findings indicate substantial progress on EBM, more than previously reported.},

              mFD
              (multifaceted functional diversity) is an R package that uses matrices of species assemblages and species trait values as building blocks to compute most FD indices.
              mFD
              is firstly based on two functions allowing the user to summarize trait and assemblage data. Then it calculates trait‐based distances between species pairs, informs the user whether species have to be clustered into functional entities and finally computes multidimensional functional space. To let the user choose the most appropriate functional space for computing multidimensional functional diversity indices, two
              mFD
              functions allow assessing and illustrating the quality of each functional space. Next,
              mFD
              provides 6 core functions to calculate 16 existing FD indices based on trait‐based distances, functional entities or species position in a functional space. The
              mFD
              package also provides graphical functions based on the
              ggplot
              library to illustrate FD values through customizable and high‐resolution plots of species distribution among functional entities or in a multidimensional space. All functions include internal validation processes to check for errors in data formatting which return detailed error messages. To facilitate the use of
              mFD

Our analyses uncovered a substantial increase in the functional richness of both ray-finned fishes (80\% of LMEs) and cartilaginous species (sharks and rays) (75\% of LMESs), in line with an increase in the taxonomic richness, extracted from these ecosystems. The functional evenness and functional divergence of these catches have also altered substantially over the time span of this study, with considerable geographic variation in the patterns detected. These trends show that global fisheries are increasingly targeting species that play diverse roles within the marine ecosystem and underline the importance of incorporating functional diversity in ecosystem management.},

In this study, we employed the gradient forest method to assess the performance of 14 key ecological indicators in terms of specificity, sensitivity and the detection of thresholds for EBFM across ten marine ecosystems using four modelling frameworks (Ecopath with Ecosim, OSMOSE, Atlantis, and a multispecies size-spectrum model). Across seven of the ten ecosystems, high specificity to fishing pressure was found for most of the 14 indicators. The indicators biomass to fisheries catch ratio (B/C), mean lifespan and trophic level of fish community were found to have wide utility for evaluating fishing impacts. The biomass indicators, which have been identified as Essential Ocean Variables by the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), had lower performance for evaluating fishing impacts, yet they were most sensitive to changes in primary productivity. The indicator B/C was most sensitive to low levels of fishing pressure with a generally consistent threshold response around 0.4*FMSY (fishing mortality rate at maximum sustainable yield) across nine of the ten ecosystems. Over 50\% of the 14 indicators had threshold responses at, or below ∼0.6* FMSY for most ecosystems, indicating that these ecosystems would have already crossed a threshold for most indicators when fished at FMSY. This research provides useful insights on the performance of indicators, which contribute to facilitating the worldwide move toward EBFM.},

                  Bottom trawl fisheries are the most widespread source of anthropogenic physical disturbance to seabed habitats. Development of fisheries‐, conservation‐ and ecosystem‐based management strategies requires the selection of indicators of the impact of bottom trawling on the state of benthic biota. Many indicators have been proposed, but no rigorous test of a range of candidate indicators against nine commonly agreed criteria (concreteness, theoretical basis, public awareness, cost, measurement, historical data, sensitivity, responsiveness, specificity) has been performed.
                
                
                  Here, we collated data from 41 studies that compared the benthic biota in trawled areas with those in control locations (that were either not trawled or trawled infrequently), examining seven potential indicators (numbers and biomass for individual taxa and whole communities, evenness, Shannon–Wiener diversity and species richness) to assess their performance against the set of nine criteria.
                
                
                  The effects of trawling were stronger on whole‐community numbers and biomass than for individual taxa. Species richness was also negatively affected by trawling but other measures of diversity were not. Community numbers and biomass met all criteria, taxa numbers and biomass and species richness satisfied most criteria, but evenness and Shannon–Wiener diversity did not respond to trawling and only met few criteria, and hence are not suitable state indicators of the effect of bottom trawling.
                
                
                  
                    Synthesis and applications
                    . An evaluation of each candidate indicator against a commonly agreed suite of desirable properties coupled with the outputs of our meta‐analysis showed that whole‐community numbers of individuals and biomass are the most suitable indicators of bottom trawling impacts as they performed well on all criteria. Strengths of these indicators are that they respond strongly to trawling, relate directly to ecosystem functioning and are straightforward to measure. Evenness and Shannon–Wiener diversity are not responsive to trawling and unsuitable for the monitoring and assessment of bottom trawl impacts.

            Samenvatting
            
              
                
                  Bodemtrawlvisserij is de grootste bron van antropogene fysieke verstoring van de zeebodemhabitats. Ontwikkeling van strategieën voor visserij en ecosystemen vereist de selectie van indicatoren voor de impact van bodemtrawling op de toestand van benthische biota. Er zijn veel verschillende indicatoren voorgesteld, maar tot nu toe er is geen rigoureuze toetsing van een reeks kandidaat‐indicatoren aan de hand van 9 algemeen overeengekomen criteria uitgevoerd (concreetheid, theoretische basis, publiek bewustzijn, kosten, meting, historische gegevens, gevoeligheid, responsiviteit, specificiteit).
                
                
                  Hier hebben we gegevens verzameld van 41 studies die de benthische biota in gebieden met bodembevissing vergeleken met die op controlelocaties (die niet of weinig bevist waren), waarbij we 7 mogelijke indicatoren (aantallen en biomassa voor individuele taxa en hele gemeenschappen, Evenness, Shannon‐Wiener‐diversiteit en soortenrijkdom) om hun prestaties te beoordelen aan de hand van 9 criteria.
                
                
                  De effecten van trawling waren sterker op de totale gemeenschap en op biomassa dan voor individuele taxa. De soortenrijkdom werd ook negatief beïnvloed door trawlvisserij, maar andere maatstaven voor diversiteit niet. Aantallen en biomassa voor de gemeenschap voldeden aan alle criteria, taxa‐aantallen en biomassa en soortenrijkdom voldeden aan de meeste criteria, maar Evenness en Shannon‐Wiener‐diversiteit reageerden niet op trawling en voldeden slechts aan enkele criteria, en zijn daarom geen geschikte statusindicatoren van het effect van bodemtrawls.
                
                
                  Synthese en toepassingen. Een evaluatie van elke kandidaat‐indicator aan de hand van een algemeen overeengekomen reeks gewenste eigenschappen in combinatie met de resultaten van onze meta‐analyse toonde aan dat het totale aantal individuen en biomassa in de hele gemeenschap de meest geschikte indicatoren zijn voor bodemtrawlingeffecten, aangezien ze goed presteerden op alle criteria. Sterke punten van deze indicatoren zijn dat ze sterk reageren op trawling, direct verband houden met het functioneren van het ecosysteem en eenvoudig te meten zijn. Evenness en Shannon‐Wiener diversiteit reageren niet op bodembevissing en zijn niet geschikt voor het monitoren en beoordelen van bodemtrawleffecten.},

          , 
            The well-documented value of marine fisheries is threatened by overfishing. Management typically focuses on target populations but lacks effective tools to document or restrain overexploitation of marine ecosystems. Here, we present three indices and accompanying thresholds to detect and delineate ecosystem overfishing (EOF): the Fogarty, Friedland, and Ryther indices. These are based on widely available and readily interpreted catch and satellite data that link fisheries landings to primary production using known limits of trophic transfer efficiency. We propose theoretically and empirically based thresholds for each of those indices; with these criteria, several ecosystems are fished sustainably, but nearly 40 to 50\% of tropical and temperate ecosystems exceed even extreme thresholds. Applying these criteria to global fisheries data results in strong evidence for two specific instances of EOF, increases in both pressure on tropical fish and a climate-mediated polar shift. Here, we show that these two patterns represent evidence for global EOF.},

Indeed, all available approaches can be easily applied at other scales and to other disciplines provided that the data have the required format: a matrix of abundance or presence/absence data of some entities in some collections and information on the differences between the entities.

Yet, these are primarily investigated by assessing abundance fluctuations of a few dominant species, which inadequately reflect ecosystem‐wide changes. In addition, it is increasingly recognized that it is not species identity per se, but their traits that determine environmental responses, biological interactions and ecosystem functioning. In this study, we investigated long‐term, spatio‐temporal variability in trait composition across multiple organism groups to assess whether functional changes occur in a similar way across trophic levels and whether shifts in trait composition link to environmental change. We combined extensive trait datasets with long‐term surveys (30–40 yr) of four organism groups (phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthic invertebrates and fish) in three environmentally distinct areas of a large marine ecosystem. We found similar temporal trajectories in the community weighted mean trait time‐series of the different trophic groups, revealing ecosystem‐wide functional changes. The traits involved and their dynamics differed between areas, concurrent with climate‐driven changes in temperature and salinity, as well as more local dynamics in nutrients and oxygen. This finding highlights the importance of considering both global climate, as well as local external drivers when studying ecosystem changes. Using a multi‐trophic trait‐based approach, our study demonstrates the importance of integrating community functional dynamics across multiple trophic levels to capture ecosystem‐wide responses which could, ultimately, help moving towards a holistic understanding, assessment and management of marine ecosystems.},

The resulting loss of species and biodiversity can cause abrupt and potentially irreversible changes in their structure and functioning. Consequently, maximizing resilience has emerged as a key concept in conservation and management. However, despite a well-developed theory, there is an urgent need for a framework that can quantify key components promoting resilience by accounting for the role of biodiversity. In this study, we applied an indicator-based approach to assess the potential resilience of marine ecosystems using the North Sea as an illustrative case study. More specifically, we quantified and compared multiple indicators of ecological resilience, estimated based on high-resolution monitoring data on marine demersal fish species, combined with information on ecological traits. Our results show a pronounced spatial structuring of indicators, including both similarities and differences among individual metrics and indicators. This implies that high resilience cannot be achieved by maximizing all individual aspects of resilience, simply because there seems to be inherent trade-offs between these components. Our framework is generic and is therefore applicable to other systems and can inform spatial planning and management.},

The objectives of the present study were to provide more accurate estimates of MTL using disaggregated taxonomic and spatial data. We applied the model of MTL to fisheries catch statistics for the state of South Australia from 1951 to 2010 and a novel set of historical market data from 1936 to 1946. Results show that from 1951 to 2010, MTL declined by 0.16 of a trophic level per decade; a rate greater than the global average of 0.10 but equivalent to similar regional investigations in other areas. This change is mainly attributable to large increases in catches of sardine, rather than reductions in the catches of high trophic level species. The pattern is maintained when the historical data is included, providing a time line from 1936 to 2010. Our results show a broadening of the catch of lower trophic levels and suggest care in interpretation of MTL of catches because reductions do not necessarily reflect change in high trophic level species by fishing pressure.},

	abstract = {Mean temperature (MTC) and mean trophic level (MTL) spatiotemporal patterns of MEDITS survey catches were examined in 13 geographic statistical areas (GSAs) of the Mediterranean between 1994 and 2016. The study aimed to detect changes in the demersal community structure related to anthropogenic impacts. A generalized additive modelling approach was used to examine the effects of year and GSA on the MTC and MTL indexes and on bottom temperature by haul. For the MTC index, the year was significant only in 4 GSAs, while for MTL it was significant in 5. Higher MTC values were observed in central and eastern areas. Bottom temperature increased after 2010, and also from west to east and from north to south. Our results indicate that the recently observed increase in bottom sea temperature has not resulted in an immediate response by demersal marine communities, but areas with higher warming rates or shallow depths were found to be more susceptible to sea warming. For MTL, decreasing trends were observed in only 2 GSAs, while the temporal trends observed in 5 GSAs may have reflected changes in fishing activity patterns. However, higher MTL values were observed in GSAs with generally higher exploitation rates, indicating that factors other than fishing play an important structuring role in marine communities. The present results indicate differences among Mediterranean subareas in regard to changes in the community structure attributed to environmental conditions and exploitation patterns and have implications for the ecology and dynamics of the stocks.},

            The role human activities play in reshaping biodiversity is increasingly apparent in terrestrial ecosystems. However, the responses of entire marine assemblages are not well-understood, in part, because few monitoring programs incorporate both spatial and temporal replication. Here, we analyse an exceptionally comprehensive 29-year time series of North Atlantic groundfish assemblages monitored over 5° latitude to the west of Scotland. These fish assemblages show no systematic change in species richness through time, but steady change in species composition, leading to an increase in spatial homogenization: the species identity of colder northern localities increasingly resembles that of warmer southern localities. This biotic homogenization mirrors the spatial pattern of unevenly rising ocean temperatures over the same time period suggesting that climate change is primarily responsible for the spatial homogenization we observe. In this and other ecosystems, apparent constancy in species richness may mask major changes in species composition driven by anthropogenic change.},

	abstract = {Understanding the spatial dynamics of biodiversity is an essential issue in marine ecology and requires combining information at local and regional scales. β-diversity is an important measure of biodiversity that informs on the differences in community composition between sites and, thus, in the species turnover in the community structure. In this study, we analysed and predicted the spatial patterns of β-diversity for fishes, in­ vertebrates and the demersal assemblage along the Iberian Mediterranean coast. We used Bayesian Bootstrap Generalized Dissimilarity Models (BBGDMs) to study the effects of environment and human pressures on the β-diversity of invertebrate, fishes and the entire demersal assemblage from 1994 to 2015 using different time windows to account for temporal variability. Then, we used these relationships to predict the spatial patterns of β-diversity in the whole Iberian Mediterranean coast. Our results highlighted that the regional spatial patterns of β-diversity were best described by bathymetry and a cumulative index of coastal impacts. We identified specific regions with the highest β-diversity in the study area, which were complementary to hotspots of species richness and presented different degree of overlapping with existent marine protected areas. Overall, our study illustrates that by modelling spatial turnover using β-diversity we can better understand and predict spatial variation of biodiversity and the effects of particular variables, providing relevant information to end-users and policy makers for designing specific spatial conservation and management strategies.},

                  The intensive exploitation of fish communities often leads to substantial reductions in the abundance of target species, with ramifications for the structure and stability of the ecosystem as a whole.
                
                
                  We explored changes in the mean trophic level of the Celtic Sea (ICES divisions VII f–j) fish community using commercial landings, survey data and estimates of trophic level derived from the analysis of nitrogen stable isotopes.
                
                
                  Our analyses showed that there has been a significant decline in the mean trophic level of survey catches from 1982 to 2000 and a decline in the trophic level of landings from 1946 to 1998.
                
                
                  The decline in mean trophic level through time resulted from a reduction in the abundance of large piscivorous fishes and an increase in smaller pelagic species which feed at a lower trophic level.
                
                
                  Similar patterns of decline in the trophic level of both catches and landings imply that there have been substantial changes in the underlying structure of the Celtic Sea fish community and not simply a change in fishery preferences.
                
                
                  We suggest that the reported changes in trophic structure result from reductions in the spawning stock biomass of traditional target species associated with intensive fishing, together with long‐term climate variability.
                
                
                  The relative distribution of fish market prices has changed significantly over the past 22 years, with high trophic level species experiencing greater price rises than lower trophic level species.
                
                
                  Although decreased abundance of high trophic level species will ultimately have negative economic consequences, the reduction in mean trophic level of the fish community as a whole may allow the system to sustain higher fishery yields.
                
                
                  Management objectives in this fishery will depend on the relative values that society attaches to economic profit and protein production.},

In response, ecological indicators have been developed to assess the state of reef ﬁsheries and their broader ecosystem-level impacts. To date, use of ﬁsheries indicators for coral reefs has been rather piecemeal, with no overarching understanding of their performance with respect to highlighting ﬁshing effects. Here, we provide a review of multispecies ﬁshery-independent indicators used to evaluate ﬁshing impacts on coral reefs. We investigate the consistency with which indicators highlight ﬁshing effects on coral reefs. We then address questions of statistical power and uncertainty, type of ﬁshing gradient, scale of analysis, the inﬂuence of other variables and the need for more work to set reference points for empirical, ﬁsheries-independent indicators on coral reefs. Our review provides knowledge that will help underpin the assessment of the ecological effects of ﬁshing, offering essential support for the development and implementation of coral reef ﬁsheries management plans.},

	abstract = {Marine biological hotspots, or areas where high abundances of species overlap in space and time, are ecologically important areas because energy flow through marine food webs, a key ecosystem process, is maximized in these areas. I investigated whether top predators aggregated at persistent spawning sites of a key forage fish species, capelin (Mallotus villosus), on the NE coast of Newfoundland during July and August 2000–2003. By examining the distributional patterns of top predators through ship-based surveys at multiple spatial and temporal scales, I found that the biomasses of birds—dominated by Common Murres (Uria aalge)—and mammals—dominated by whale species—were concentrated along the coast, with a biological hotspot forming near two persistent spawning sites of capelin in all years. The formation of this hotspot was well defined in space and time from middle of July to middle of August, likely coinciding with the spawning chronology of capelin. Within this hotspot, there was a high spatial and temporal overlap of Common Murres and gill nets set to capture Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). This resulted in breeding murres becoming entangled in gill nets while feeding on spawning capelin. Despite an acknowledged uncertainty of bycatch mortality, estimates for the larger regional-scale area (1936–4973 murres/year; 0.2–0.6\% of the breeding population) underestimated mortality relative to estimates within the hotspot (3053–14054 murres/year; 0.4–1.7\%). Although fishing effort for Atlantic cod has declined substantially since the groundfish moratorium in 1992, chronic, unnatural, and additive mortality through bycatch continues in coastal Newfoundland. Restricted use of gill nets within this and other biological hotspots during the capelin spawning period appears to be a straightforward application of the “ecological and biologically significant area” management framework in Canada’s Oceans Act. This protection would minimize murre bycatch and maintain ecosystem integrity.},

Given their irreplaceable role in ecosystems and their high extinction risk, we used a 24-­year time series (1997–2020) of scientific bottom trawl surveys to examine the effects of climate change on the spatial distribution of nine elasmobranch species within Northeast Atlantic waters. Using a hierarchical modeling of species communities, belonging to the joint species distribution models, we found that suitable habitats for four species increased on average by a factor of 1.6 and, for six species, shifted north-­eastwards and/or to deeper waters over the past two decades. By integrating species traits, we showed changes in habitat suitability led to changes in the elasmobranchs trait composition. Moreover, communities shifted to deeper waters and their mean trophic level decreased. We also note an increase in the mean community size at maturity concurrent with a decrease in fecundity. Because skates and sharks are functionally unique and dangerously vulnerable to both climate change and fishing, we advocate for urgent considerations of species traits in management measures. Their use would make it better to identify species whose loss could have irreversible impacts in face of the myriad of anthropogenic threats.},

This study identifies gaps and bias in media coverage of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), an international agreement regulating trade in flora and fauna that attracts a significant amount of public attention, and that has in recent years increasingly incorporated protections for commercially exploited marine species. To examine one contributor to public understanding of processes and outcomes for marine species conservation at CITES, we performed a media content and discourse analysis for popular press articles from English-speaking newspapers worldwide (N = 102). Our analysis focused on how, and how often, marine species issues are discussed in the media, which experts are interviewed, which perspectives are highlighted, and whether important details and nuances known to experts are presented accurately (or at all). We show that proposals to list marine species on CITES appendices are discussed less often than proposals to list charismatic terrestrial species (e.g., elephants), and these proposals for trade controls on marine species are framed differently. Discussions centering on sharks and rays as a homogeneous group far exceed discussions of individual species, despite notably distinct risk profiles for different species. Extinction is rarely discussed and is poorly explained in the context of marine species. The contribution of marine species exploitation to local and global food security issues and fisher livelihoods is not discussed at all. Advocates from environmental non-profit groups dominate the list of interviewed experts, with alternative perspectives from groups linked to sustainable management like UNFAO (the United Nations agency with a fisheries mandate) and academics, rarely mentioned. Additionally, the fishing industry’s perspective on issues surrounding the conservation of commercially exploited marine species is rarely represented. Recommendations for both follow-up research and practical steps to ensure a more balanced inclusion of the perspectives of key stakeholders are included.},

Characterizing the global bycatch seascape using data on bycatch rates across ﬁsheries is essential for highlighting conservation priorities. We compiled a comprehensive database of reported data on marine turtle bycatch in gillnet, longline, and trawl ﬁsheries worldwide from 1990 to 2008. The total reported global marine turtle bycatch was ∼85,000 turtles, but due to the small percentage of ﬁshing effort observed and reported (typically {\textless}1\% of total ﬂeets), and to a global lack of bycatch information from small-scale ﬁsheries, this likely underestimates the true total by at least two orders of magnitude. Our synthesis also highlights an apparently universal pattern across ﬁshing gears and regions where high bycatch rates were associated with low observed effort, which emphasizes the need for strategic bycatch data collection and reporting. This study provides the ﬁrst global perspective of ﬁsheries bycatch for marine turtles and highlights region–gear combinations that warrant urgent conservation action (e.g., gillnets, longlines, and trawls in the Mediterranean Sea and eastern Paciﬁc Ocean) and region–gear combinations in need of enhanced observation and reporting efforts (e.g., eastern Indian Ocean gillnets, West African trawls).},

In the last decade, the fisheries stock assessment modeling framework Stock Synthesis (SS3) has become widely used around the world. However, there lacks a generalized and scriptable framework for SS3 simulation testing. Here, we introduce ss3sim, an R package that facilitates reproducible, flexible, and rapid end-to-end simulation testing with SS3. ss3sim requires an existing SS3 model configuration along with plain-text control files describing alternative population dynamics, fishery properties, sampling scenarios, and assessment approaches. ss3sim then generates an underlying ‘truth’ from a specified operating model, samples from that truth, modifies and runs an estimation model, and synthesizes the results. The simulations can be run in parallel, reducing runtime, and the source code is free to be modified under an open-source MIT license. ss3sim is designed to explore structural differences between the underlying truth and assumptions of an estimation model, or between multiple estimation model configurations. For example, ss3sim can be used to answer questions about model misspecification, retrospective patterns, and the relative importance of different types of fisheries data. We demonstrate the software with an example, discuss how ss3sim complements other simulation software, and outline specific research questions that ss3sim could address.},

One-third of threatened deepwater sharks are targeted, and half the species targeted for the international liver-oil trade are threatened with extinction. Steep population declines cannot be easily reversed owing to long generation lengths, low recovery potentials, and the near absence of management. Depth and spatial limits to fishing activity could improve conservation when implemented alongside catch regulations, bycatch mitigation, and international trade regulation. Deepwater sharks and rays require immediate trade and fishing regulations to prevent irreversible defaunation and promote recovery of this threatened megafauna group.

            Editor’s summary
            
              Over the past decade, the plight of the world’s sharks has received increasing attention, leading to increased regulation and finning bans. However, whether this increased attention has translated into improved outcomes for sharks is unclear. Finucci
              et al
              . found a need for increased regulations in their study of deep sea sharks and rays, which are experiencing declines due to increased fishing mortality, particularly when targeted for oil and meat. Increased regulations are urgent, because the potential for most sharks to recover from such declines is limited due to their slow development and reproduction. —Sacha Vignieri

However, there is a lack of life history information (age, growth, and maturity) available for this species to inform conservation and management efforts. A total of 48 R. australiae samples were purchased from 2 fishing ports in Singapore between July 2018–July 2019. Species identification was confirmed by mtDNA barcoding using the NADH2 region. Length of specimens ranged from 506–1645 mm total length (TL), and ages ranged from 0–11 yr. Multi-model analysis was used to estimate growth parameters using a Bayesian approach with informative priors. The von Bertalanffy model was the best fitting growth model for the combined sexes (L∞ = 2814 mm TL; L0 = 517 mm TL; k = 0.07 yr–1), for females only (L∞ = 3053 mm TL; L0 = 504 mm TL; k = 0.06 yr–1), and for males only (L∞ = 2741 mm TL; L0 = 497 mm TL; k = 0.07 yr–1). Preliminary results indicate that females and males may mature at different ages and lengths, with females (A50 = 3.25 yr; L50 = 1014 mm TL) matured younger and at smaller sizes, than males (A50 = 5.03 yr; L50 = 1197 mm TL). R. australiae has an estimated theoretical longevity of 40 and 47 yr for males and females, respectively. This study provides the first preliminary species-specific life history information for R. australiae, suggesting that this species in Southeast Asian waters is slowgrowing. This information will further the biological knowledge available for this species and can be used to help design effective management and conservation measures.},

                  Medium‐ to large‐scale marine protected areas (MPAs) are playing an increasingly important role in global marine biodiversity conservation. A key question is “how do we collect relevant data on biodiversity and population trends to inform their design and measure success?”
                
                
                  This question is particularly relevant for marine taxa that are difficult to survey, such as sharks and rays, and where populations may occur over vast areas. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding has proven to be an effective sampling method and may provide a solution to these challenges; however, it remains unclear how its sampling effectiveness compares with traditionally used methods for elasmobranch surveying.
                
                
                  
                    Here, we directly compared the efficacy of eDNA metabarcoding and demersal longline deployments to survey elasmobranchs across 31 sites over a 55,000 km
                    2
                    area of the Kimberley and Roebuck Australian Marine Parks in Australia's North‐west Marine Parks Network.
                  
                
                
                  In total, we documented 49 unique elasmobranch taxa, 36 of which were detected by eDNA and 32 (from a total of 815 captured sharks) by longline. A combined approach yielded over 34\% more elasmobranch taxa than either method alone.
                
                
                  Site community compositions varied between the two survey methods; notably eDNA was able to detect species from outside of the immediate sampling area, although this was still consistent with a detection radius of a few kilometres, highlighting a particular use in rugose reef habitats where it is difficult to deploy longlines.
                
                
                  In investigating the quantitative use of eDNA data, we report that eDNA metabarcoding read abundance (count) data was poorly correlated with longline aggregate catch (count and biomass) data across raw, relative and rank abundance measures. However, we found that in multivariate analyses, both binary (presence–absence) and abundance (after square‐root transformation) datasets produced highly similar ordination patterns, largely segregating method (eDNA vs. longline), followed by latitude and depth.
                
                
                  Lastly, we identified required levels of eDNA replication and longline deployments to maximize captured elasmobranch diversity.
                
                
                  This study sets an integrated, georeferenced baseline and long‐term monitoring approach for the management and conservation of elasmobranch diversity within this unique marine park network.},

Social and economic information is limited for coastal commercial and recreational ﬁsheries, particularly shark ﬁsheries, which are perceived as unsustainable and as targeting sharks for ﬁns. Aims. To characterise the social and economic dimensions of one of the world’s few longstanding sustainable shark ﬁsheries. Methods. We reviewed historic data and surveyed stakeholders to understand the economic and social dimensions of the shark ﬁshery currently operating in Western Australia. Key results. Since the ﬁshery’s historic peak, there has been a substantial reduction in the number of operating vessels and ports due to management intervention. For the vessels that have remained, catches and catch rates increased through time. Fishers sold only ﬂesh and ﬁns, whereas processors also sold cartilage. Revenue mostly originates from the domestic sale of ﬂesh, not ﬁns. This ﬁshery provides additional social and economic returns through the employment of an average of 102 people per annum, the supply of local fresh seafood to communities and the expenditure of most of operational costs in local government areas. In addition, the average annual market value through the supply chain was A\$32.6 × 106 (US\$20.9 × 106). Conclusions. Our study is the ﬁrst step towards a more comprehensive valuation of the societal contribution of sustainable shark ﬁsheries. Implications. This novel information has a range of applications, from developing social and economic objectives in ﬁsheries harvest strategies to empowering government agencies when making decisions on natural resource management.},

Substantial declines in white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) presence at two primary aggregation sites have raised concerns about the species’ status throughout South Af­ rica. Using the most comprehensive suite of abundance indices compiled to date, we evaluated temporal trends and the strength of evidence for regional redistribution. Individual indices from all primary aggregation sites in South Africa were highly variable. The overall temporal trend from a log-linear Generalized Additive Model was relatively flat, indicating largely unchanged abundance throughout South Africa since protection in 1991. However, reports of human-shark incidents showed a general shift from the Western to the Eastern Cape. Cor­ relations among individual abundance indices demonstrated that movements were not as simple as animals leaving one site to inhabit another. Further research is needed to explore the effect of movement on monitoring data. Our results reaffirm the need for better standardization in data collection methods to generate abundance indices and to develop long-term monitoring programs on the Eastern Cape. Ideally, environmental or opera­ tional factors affecting abundance indices should also be explored in future status assessments at a regional level. Our results provide a baseline for future work, directing research to understand drivers of localized and regional changes and focusing management on reducing anthropogenic sources of mortality within their Southwest Indian Ocean range.},

This study used single nucleotide polymorphisms to investigate ﬁne-scale population structure in S. mokarran across the Indo-Paciﬁc. Methods. DNA was extracted from 235 individuals across six Australian locations and a Red Sea outgroup. Population parameters were calculated and visualised to test structuring across locations. Key results. No ﬁne-scale population structuring was observed for S. mokarran across the Indo-Paciﬁc. However, population structuring occurred for all Australian locations when compared to the Red Sea outgroup. Conclusions. Findings suggest a single stock is most likely for S. mokarran found in Australian waters. Results provide key information for understanding the broad range movements of S. mokarran and help to deﬁne the scale of management required to preserve genetic diversity in this species. The structuring between Australia and the Red Sea indicates limited gene ﬂow and movement. Implications. Results indicate that large-scale movements of S. mokarran could be occurring to facilitate genetic mixing. Future research focusing on individual tagging to corroborate movements would be highly beneﬁcial to determine how far (and often) individuals are dispersing, and to note where cross-jurisdictional management, including from neighbouring regions in the Indo-West Paciﬁc–Oceania region, are most critical.},

Using three critically endangered, frequently illegally traded Philippine species, the Palawan forest turtle (Siebenrockiella leytensis), the Philippine cockatoo (Cacatua haematuropygia), and the Philippine pangolin (Manis culionensisis), we demonstrate that using these methods, we can more accurately assign provenance using pXRF data (x = 83\%) than SIA data (x = 47\%).

The scalloped hammerhead and greeneye spurdog were being sold under the label ‘ﬂake’. Overall, 70\% of samples were mislabelled and the proportion of mislabelling was signiﬁcantly greater in takeaways compared with ﬁsh markets and wholesalers. Conclusions. High levels of mislabelling of shark product in Australian ﬁsh markets and seafood shops was apparent both with respect to the genetically identiﬁed shark sample not matching the label and the use of ambiguous labels that do not adhere to the Australian Fish Names Standard. Mislabelling masked the presence of threatened species. Implications. Our results reveal labelling practices that are not providing consumers with reliable information to identify shark products, and we demonstrate the utility of molecular methods in seafood trade monitoring.},

            Human impacts lead to widespread changes in the abundance, diversity and traits of shark assemblages, altering the functioning of coastal ecosystems. The functional consequences of shark declines are often poorly understood due to the absence of empirical data describing long-term change. We use data from the Queensland Shark Control Program in eastern Australia, which has deployed mesh nets and baited hooks across 80 beaches using standardised methodologies since 1962. We illustrate consistent declines in shark functional richness quantified using both ecological (e.g., feeding, habitat and movement) and morphological (e.g., size, morphology) traits, and this corresponds with declining ecological functioning. We demonstrate a community shift from targeted apex sharks to a greater functional richness of non-target species. Declines in apex shark functional richness and corresponding changes in non-target species may lead to an anthropogenically induced trophic cascade. We suggest that repairing diminished shark populations is crucial for the stability of coastal ecosystems.},

	abstract = {While much of traditional ﬁsheries theory has concentrated on maximum or optimum yield, the reality of ﬁsheries management is that biomass yield is only one of the several indicators of ﬁsheries performance, and desired outcomes generally only need to provide something near the maximum possible yield. A range of policies are explored to ﬁnd those that produce ‘‘Pretty Good Yield’’ deﬁned as sustainable yield at least 80\% of the maximum sustainable yield. Such yields are generally obtained over a broad range of stock sizes (20–50\% of unﬁshed stock abundance), and this range is not sensitive to the population’s basic life history parameters such as natural mortality rate, somatic growth rate, or age at maturity. The most important biological parameter determining this range is the intensity of recruitment compensation. Meta-analysis shows compensation is usually strong and there is reasonably little yield lost at what are now widely accepted deﬁnitions of overﬁshing or risk for most stocks. Similarly, maintaining stocks at 50\% of unﬁshed stock abundance for ecological or economic reasons results in little expected loss of yield.},

	abstract = {We examined spatial and temporal variations in the demersal fish assemblage on the continental shelf of the central Great Australian Bight to understand how the assemblage is affected by both fishing and environmental gradients. Data from the Great Australian Bight Trawl Sector (1988–2018) and fishery-independent trawl surveys (2005–2009, 2011, 2015, 2018) were used for the analyses. The independent survey data were used to analyse trends in overall species composition and abundances, while the commercial fishery data were used to extend the time series for the key commercial species, Deepwater Flathead (Platycephalus conatus) and Bight Redfish (Centroberyx gerrardi). The demersal fish assemblage was dominated by four commercial species: Deepwater Flathead, Bight Redfish, Ocean Jacket (Nelusetta ayraud), and Latchet (Pterygotrigla polyommata); and one bycatch species: Wide Stingaree (Urolophus expansus). Assemblage composition varied between day/night and along an east-west gradient. Survey abundance and commercial catch-per-unit-effort of several species declined at the end of the time series. Survey abundance was low in 2011, 2015, and 2018 for Bight Redfish and in 2015 and 2018 for Deepwater Flathead. Assemblage composition and catch rates of some species recorded in 2011, 2015, and 2018 were distinct from previous years, but the differences appear to reflect the longer gaps between these surveys and the combined effects of historical fishing pressure and environmental variability. Recent downward trends in the abundance indices of target species, as well as long-term changes in the assemblage, demonstrate the need for continued fishery-independent monitoring. The relative importance of fishing pressure, environmental variability, and other human activities in driving these changes warrant further investigation.},
