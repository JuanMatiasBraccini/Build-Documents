  abstract = {Management and conservation of the North Atlantic blue shark are handicapped by a fishery-data-limited stock-assessment process. The status of this stock is ambiguous at a time when catch appears to be on the rise and new trade and exploitation patterns are emerging. This research provides fishery-independent demographic and risk analysis results for use in conservation and management. An age-structured matrix population model in which the vital rates are stochastic was constructed. A mean finite rate of population increase (++) of 1.23 year–1 and a mean population doubling time (t2) of 3.08 years suggests that the blue shark is one of the most productive shark species. However, this concept of high productivity could be misleading because an elasticity analysis shows a strong dependence of the population growth rate on the survival of juveniles (0–4 years). An analysis of the risk that the harvested population will decline to levels below an assumed threshold of 50\% of pre-exploited levels was conducted. The risk analysis is proposed as a supplement to the data-limited stock assessment, to better evaluate the probability that a given management strategy will put the population at risk of decline},

We quantified patterns in catch rates and mean size for numerous tropical and subtropical species from 15 years of fishery-independent surveys (2002–2017) in northwestern Australia. This study region represents an area of  ̃0.8 million km2 which was closed to commercial shark fishing from 1993 or 2005 onward due to the very high State-wide catches of sandbar (Carcharhinus plumbeus) and dusky (Carcharhinus obscurus) sharks. A total of 43 shark and ray species were sampled, with sandbar shark being the most commonly caught species, followed by milk (Rhizoprionodon acutus), spot-tail (Carcharhinus sorrah), tiger (Galeocerdo cuvier), blacktip (Carcharhinus limbatus and Carcharhinus tilstoni), dusky and sliteye (Loxodon macrorhinus) sharks, and scalloped hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini). For sandbar shark, catch rates increased between 2008 and 2017 whereas for other taxa catch rates were mostly stable (albeit fluctuating). Mean size at capture fluctuated across years with no particular trends. Unlike for other parts of the world, catch rates and mean size of northwestern Australian sharks have been stable or increased in recent years. Though most shark species have conservative life histories, when science, management and enforcement work synergistically, sustainable resource use, recovery and conservation outcomes can all be achieved.},

In Western Australia (WA), commercial shark fishing commenced in the 1940s; however, catch time series are not available for discarded species. The present study quantified catch (i.e. dead individuals) time series of discarded sharks and rays in WA’s shark fisheries using on-board observer information collected since 1993 and testing assumptions through sensitivity analysis. Overall, 18 shark and ray taxonomic groups were discarded, comprising ,20\% of the observed catch by number. Port Jackson shark, southern eagle ray and spurdogs were the most commonly discarded elasmobranchs, followed by western wobbegong, angel sharks, stingrays, and guitarfish and shovelnose rays. For the base case scenario, the catch of these species was small, peaking at 12.6, 5.6, 1.3, 1.8, 4, 1.3 and 2.7 tonnes (Mg) respectively, given their low post-release mortality (PRM). Current catch levels were even lower (e.g. ,5 Mg for Port Jackson shark). Other discarded elasmobranchs were rarely caught. Assuming 100\% PRM resulted in higher annual catches, highlighting the need for further research on the PRM of sharks and rays. The reconstructed catch series will be used in risk assessments to determine the sustainability of discarded species.},

Eighty‐five percent of individuals were released with an unknown status (alive or dead). We found a latitudinal gradient of species composition, with tropical and subtropical species of the genus Carcharhinus dominating in the north and temperate species from a range of families dominating in the south. Overall, our findings showed that the recreational harvest was negligible when compared with commercial landings.},

  abstract = {Integrated analysis has increasingly been the preferred approach for conducting stock assessments and providing the basis for management advice for fish and invertebrate stocks around the world. Many decisions are required when developing integrated stock assessments. For example, the analyst needs to decide whether the model fits the data, if the optimization was successful, if estimates are consistent retrospectively, and if the model is suitable to predict future stock responses to fishing. This study provides practical guidelines for implementing selected diagnostic tools that can assist analysts in identifying problems with model specifications and alternatives that can be explored to minimize or eliminate such problems. Emphasis is placed on reviewing the implementation and interpretation of contemporary model diagnostic tools. We first describe each diagnostic approach and its utility. We then proceed by providing a “cookbook recipe” on how to implement each of the diagnostics, together with an interpretation of the results, using two worked examples of integrated stock assessments with Stock Synthesis. Further, we provide a conceptual flow chart that lays out a generic process of model development and selection using the presented model diagnostics. Based on this, we propose the following four properties as objective criteria for evaluating the plausibility of a model: (1) model convergence, (2) fit to the data, (3) model consistency, and (4) prediction skill. It would greatly benefit the stock assessment community if the next gen­ eration of stock assessment models could include the diagnostic tests presented in this study as a set of open source tools.},

  abstract = {An Integrated Risk Assessment for Climate Change (IRACC) is developed and applied to assess the vulnerability of sharks and rays on Australia’s Great Barrier Reef (GBR) to climate change. The IRACC merges a traditional climate change vulnerability framework with approaches from fisheries ecological risk assessments. This semi-quantitative assessment accommodates uncertainty and can be applied at different spatial and temporal scales to identify exposure factors, at-risk species and their key biological and ecological attributes, critical habitats a‘nd ecological processes, and major knowledge gaps. Consequently, the IRACC can provide a foundation upon which to develop climate change response strategies. Here, we describe the assessment process, demonstrate its application to GBR shark and ray species, and explore the issues affecting their vulnerability to climate change. The assessment indicates that for the GBR, freshwater/estuarine and reef associated sharks and rays are most vulnerable to climate change, and that vulnerability is driven by case-specific interactions of multiple factors and species attributes. Changes in temperature, freshwater input and ocean circulation will have the most widespread effects on these species. Although relatively few GBR sharks and rays were assessed as highly vulnerable, their vulnerability increases when synergies with other factors are considered. This is especially true for freshwater/estuarine and coastal/inshore sharks and rays. Reducing the impacts of climate change on the GBR’s sharks and rays requires a range of approaches including mitigating climate change and addressing habitat degradation and sustainability issues. Species-specific conservation actions may be required for higher risk species (e.g. the freshwater whipray, porcupine ray, speartooth shark and sawfishes) including reducing mortality, preserving coastal catchments and estuarine habitats, and addressing fisheries sustainability. The assessment identified many knowledge gaps concerning GBR habitats and processes, and highlights the need for improved understanding of the biology and ecology of the sharks and rays of the GBR.},

  abstract = {Stock Synthesis (SS) is a likelihood-based statistical catch-at-age modeling environment allowing multiple data sources to be used to characterize population dynamics through time. While it is typically applied in data-rich circumstances, its suitability in data-limited situations is investigated in this work. Two " Simple Stock Synthesis" (SSS) approaches are outlined, each developed to mimic the Depletion-Based Stock Reduction Analysis (DB-SRA) estimation of overfishing limits (OFLs) currently applied to data-limited U.S. west coast groundfish species. SSS-MC uses Monte Carlo draws of natural mortality, steepness, and stock depletion and estimates initial recruitment, while SSS-MCMC estimates natural mortality, steepness, and initial recruitment while fitting to an artificial abundance survey representing stock depletion with an error distribution equivalent to the stock depletion prior used in DB-SRA. These approaches are applied to 45 species of unassessed groundfishes in the Pacific Fishery Management Council Groundfish Fishery Management Plan, and the OFL estimates are compared to corresponding DB-SRA estimates. Despite model structure and parameter specification differences, SSS led to results comparable to DB-SRA over a wide range of species and life histories. SSS models with sex-specific life history parameters and growth variability are also presented as examples of how the inherent flexibility of SS can be used to account for more uncertainty in derived quantities. SSS-MCMC, while exhibiting statistically undesirable traits due to the inclusion of the artificial survey, readily includes data-informed abundance surveys into an assessment framework consistent with more complex, data-informed assessments. Establishment of viable data-limited approaches in SS is a convenient first steps in " building-up" stock assessments towards fuller implementation in SS when additional data become available, while also providing a way to inform management in data-limited situations. © 2012.},

  abstract = {Natural morality (M) is a notoriously difficult population parameter to estimate, yet it is also one of the most important measures of life history that sets, as Beverton and Holt called it, "the course of events". Stock as­ sessments that include this parameter often show great sensitivity to its value, reflecting the need to characetrize the uncertainty inherent in its estimation. Direct measurement of natural mortality is often limited to resource intensive tag-recapture studies. Indirect measures are more often used, and are built on life history theory, relating natural mortality to traits such as age, size, maturity and reproductive condition (or just assuming 0.2). The Natural Mortality Tool attempts to accumulate several empirical estimators of M into one application. Users simply input life history values to obtain estimates of natural mortality. These estimates can be taken individ­ ually or can be combined into a weighted density function that can be used to develop an M prior that integrates uncertainty across several estimates. Comparing estimators can also reveal inconsistencies in life history values that may lead to further refining of basic biological understanding. Two examples are used to demonstrate tool functionality and highlight general recommendations on implementation. Making these estimators and the development of uncertainty in estimating natural mortality more widely available hopefully supports transparent and defensible decision-making on the treatment of this important population parameter.},

  abstract = {An Ecological Risk Assessment (ERA; also known as Productivity and Susceptibility Analysis, PSA) was conducted on sixteen species (15 sharks and 1 ray) or 20 stocks of pelagic elasmobranchs to assess their vulnerability to pelagic longline fisheries in the Atlantic Ocean. This was a quantitative assessment consisting of a risk analysis to evaluate the biological productivity of these stocks and a susceptibility analysis to assess their propensity to capture and mortality in pelagic longline fisheries. The risk analysis estimated productivity (maximum rate of increase, r) using a stochastic life table/Leslie matrix approach that incorporated uncertainty in age at maturity, lifespan, and both age-specific natural mortality and fecundity. Susceptibility to the fishery was calculated as the product of four components, which were also computed quantitatively: availability of the species to the fleet, encounterability of the gear given the species vertical distribution, gear selectivity, and post-capture mortality. Information from observer programs by ten ICCAT nations was used to derive fleet-specific susceptibility values. Three metrics were used to calculate vulnerability (Euclidean distance, a multiplicative index, and the arithmetic mean of the productivity and susceptibility ranks). The five stocks with the lowest productivity were the bigeye thresher (Alopias superciliosus), sandbar (Carcharhinus plumbeus), longfin mako (Isurus paucus), night (Carcharhinus signatus), and South Atlantic silky shark (Carcharhinus falciformis). The highest susceptibility values corresponded to shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus), North and South Atlantic blue sharks (Prionace glauca), porbeagle (Lamna nasus), and bigeye thresher. Based on the arithmetic mean vulnerability index, which did not show preferential correlation with the productivity or susceptibility indices, the bigeye thresher, longfin and shortfin makos, porbeagle, and night sharks were the most vulnerable stocks. In contrast, North and South Atlantic scalloped hammerheads (Sphyrna lewini), smooth hammerhead (Sphyrna zygaena), and North and South Atlantic pelagic stingray (Pteroplatytrygon violacea) had the lowest vulnerabilities.},

  abstract = {Stock assessments are integral to fisheries management, and the demand for stock assessments based on population dynamics models continues to increase. Historically, stock assessments have been based on bespoke methods and software. There is now a trend towards the use of flexible, documented, tested and maintained software packages, because use of such packages increases efficiency and consistency in assessments and should lead to more reliable and repeatable assessment outcomes. We have developed a web-site that collates available stock assessment packages (from data-limited to -rich) to provide assessment analysts with a single platform that summarizes the features of the available packages in a consistent manner. We also highlight current state-of-the-art packages, and those that are no longer supported or have been superseded. In addition to providing the packages, the web-site facilitates users of packages to provide feedback to developers regarding which features of other packages could be included in future versions of their packages. We see this effort as a way to support the design of the next generation stock assessment package.},

  abstract = {We describe a method for determining reasonable yield and management reference points for data-poor fisheries in cases where approximate catches are known from the beginning of exploitation. The method, called Depletion-Based Stock Reduction Analysis (DB-SRA), merges stochastic Stock-Reduction Analysis with Depletion-Corrected Average Catch. Data requirements include estimates of historical annual catches, approximate natural mortality rate and age at maturity. A production function is specified based on general fishery knowledge of the relative location of maximum productivity and the relationship of MSY fishing rate to the natural mortality rate. This leaves unfished biomass as the only unknown parameter, which can be estimated given a designated relative depletion level near the end of the time series. The method produces probability distributions of management reference points concerning yield and biomass. Uncertainties in natural mortality, stock dynamics, optimal harvest rates, and recent stock status are incorporated using Monte Carlo exploration. Comparison of model outputs to data-rich stock assessments suggests that the method is effective for estimating sustainable yields for data-poor stocks},

  abstract = {Natural mortality, M, is a key parameter for the assessment and management of living resources but is difficult to observe directly. Therefore, M is often estimated indirectly from life history traits, and it is typically assumed to be invariant over size, age, and time. Such indirect estimators are particularly relevant for data-poor species, including many elasmobranchs (sharks, skates, and rays). However, as commonly used estimators were developed largely with teleost (bony fish) data, their performance for elasmobranchs is currently unknown. Here, we show that the relationship between observed maximum age, tmax, and mean adult M is not significantly different between teleosts (n = 105) and elasmobranchs (n = 15). Furthermore, data on 16 teleosts and 2 elasmobranchs suggest that juvenile M can be estimated from adult M when juvenile M is inversely proportional to body length and when a reference length can be provided. We introduce this reference length as the length at the age after which M is assumed to be constant and demonstrate how it can be estimated using the von Bertalanffy growth function and the proportion surviving to tmax, which is shown to be approximately 1−2\%. The data utilized here also suggest that if tmax is unknown it can be estimated from growth information by assuming that 99\% of the asymptotic maximum length is reached at tmax. Based on these life history parameters, the same indirect M estimators can be utilized for teleosts and elasmobranchs, which may contribute to more reliable assessments of data-poor species.},

Informative priors are important in obtaining the Bayesian posterior distributions for estimated parameters in stock assessment. In the case of the steepness parameter (A), the need for an informative prior is particularly important because it determines the stock-recruitment relationships in the model. However, specifications of the priors for the h parameter are often subjective. We used a simple population model to derive h priors based on life history considerations. The model was based on the evolutionary principle that persistence of any species, given its life history (i.e., natural mortality rate) and its exposure to recruitment variability, requires a minimum recruitment compensation that enables the species to rebound consistently from low critical abundances (Nc). Using the model, we derived the prior probability distributions of the h parameter for fish species that have a range of natural mortality, recruitment variabilities, and Nc values.},

  abstract = {Conservation concerns exist for many sharks but robust estimates of abundance are often lacking. Improving population status is a performance measure for species under conservation or recovery plans, yet the lack of data permitting estimation of population size means the efficacy of management actions can be difficult to assess, and achieving the goal of removing species from conservation listing challenging. For potentially dangerous species, like the white shark, balancing conservation and public safety demands is politically and socially complex, often leading to vigorous debate about their population status. This increases the need for robust information to inform policy decisions. We developed a novel method for estimating the total abundance of white sharks in eastern Australia and New Zealand using the genetic-relatedness of juveniles and applying a close-kin mark-recapture framework and demographic model. Estimated numbers of adults are small (ca. 280–650), as is total population size (ca. 2,500–6,750). However, estimates of survival probability are high for adults (over 90\%), and fairly high for juveniles (around 73\%). This represents the first direct estimate of total white shark abundance and survival calculated from data across both the spatial and temporal life-history of the animal and provides a pathway to estimate population trend.},

We identify and discuss advantages and challenges of ensemble modelling approaches in the context of scientific advice. There are uncertainties associated with every phase in the stock assessment process: data collection, assessment model choice, model assumptions, interpretation of risk, up to the implementation of management advice. Additionally, the dynamics of fish populations are complex, and our incomplete understanding of those dynamics and limited observations of important mechanisms, necessitate that models are simpler than nature. The aim is for the model to capture enough of the dynamics to accurately estimate trends and abundance, and provide the basis for robust advice about sustainable harvests. The status quo approach to assessment modelling has been to identify the "best"model and generate advice from that model, mostly ignoring advice from other model configurations regardless of how closely they performed relative to the chosen model. We discuss and make suggestions about the utility of ensemble models, including revisions to the formal process of providing advice to management bodies, and recommend further research to evaluate potential gains in modelling and advice performance.},

A pre-recruit survival model for the early life history of elasmobranchs was developed and parameterized using biological data. Then, an existing age-structured model for the reproductive ecology of teleost fishes was modified for elasmobranchs and combined with the pre-recruit model. The combined model was then applied to the North Pacific blue shark (Prionace glauca). The stock-recruitment relationships of this species were clarified using the biological data collected from wide areas of the western North Pacific. The model provides a point estimate for steepness, which represents a fraction of the unfished recruitment when spawning stock biomass is 20\% of the unfished spawning stock biomass. Numerical simulations were conducted to incorporate uncertainties in the biological parameters and produce the variance of steepness. The mean value and its standard deviation for steepness with the Beverton-Holt model were 0.584 (standard deviation = 0.099). The results suggest that the stock-recruitment relationship in North Pacific blue shark remains highly density-dependent and that its productivity is higher than that of other viviparous elasmobranchs.},

  abstract = {The relationship between body weight and natural mortality in juvenile and adult fish was analysed for different aquatic ecosystems: lakes, rivers, the ocean, and pond, cage and tank aquaculture systems. Mortality was modelled as a power function of weight, and the parameters b (exponent) and Mu (mortality at the unit weight of 1 g) estimated for fish in the six ecosystems, as well as within selected populations, species and families. At the ecosystem level, no significant differences in parameters were found between lakes, rivers and the ocean and a joint mortality-weight relationship for all natural ecosystems was estimated with parameters b=−0.288 (90\% CL[−0.315, −0.261]) and Mu=3.00 (90\% CL[2.70, 3.30]) year−1. Among the culture systems, mortality-weight relationships in ponds and cages were not significantly different and a joint relationship was estimated. The weight exponents of mortality in ponds/cages and tanks were very similar at about b=−0.43, and significantly more negative than in natural ecosystems. Mortalities at unit weight were significantly lower in tanks (0.91 year−1) than in ponds/cages (2.24 year−1), and both were significantly lower than in natural ecosystems. No systematic differences were found between the mortality-weight relationships determined for individual populations, species or families, and fish in the respective ecosystems. It is hypothesized that aquaculture mortality-weight relationships indicate the allometric scaling of non-predation mortality, which is therefore more strongly size dependent than predation mortality. If non predation mortality in natural ecosystems shows a similar scaling with body weight, then the allometric exponent of predation mortality must be less negative than that observed for total natural mortality. Implications of the established mortality-weight relationships for aquaculture and culture-based fisheries are discussed},

A method for evaluating the impacts of fishing mortality and stochastic influences on the demography of two long-lived shark stocks. — ICES Journal of Marine Science, 64.Stochastic demographic models were developed for Carcharhinus obscurus and C. plumbeus populations off the west coast of Australia by resampling the input parameters for life tables from empirical biological data collected from commercial target fisheries and fishery-independent surveys. The models were used to examine the effects of multiple scenarios of age-specific survival, derived from the fishing mortality rates estimated from a tagging study on sharks and indirect estimates of natural mortality. In the absence of fishing, median estimates of the rates of intrinsic population increase (r) were 0.025 for both species. Inclusion of the age-specific fishing mortality rates estimated for C. obscurus recruits born in 1994 and 1995 resulted in the median estimates of r declining to 0.007 and 0.012, respectively, suggesting that recent harvest levels of mainly neonates by the target fishery were probably sustainable. However, the model also suggested that the population was more susceptible to exploitation of older sharks than was previously believed. The C. plumbeus model indicated that fishing mortality between 2001 and 2004 was probably unsustainable. The increasingly negative trend in median r estimates (from –0.032 to –0.049), and the population’s apparently limited capacity for density-dependent compensation through changes in fecundity, somatic growth and longevity, suggests that management intervention is necessary to prevent continued stock depletion},

The flexibility of integrated analysis models allows them to be applied over extended time periods spanning historical decades with little information from which to estimate the annual signal of recruitment variability to modern periods in which more information about recruitment variability exists. Across this range of data availability, the estimation process must assure that the estimated log-normally distributed recruitments are mean unbiased to assure mean unbiased biomass estimates. Here we show how the estimation method implemented in the integrated analysis model, Stock Synthesis, achieves this unbiased characteristic in a penalized likelihood approach that is comparable to the results from Markov chain Monte Carlo. The total variability in recruitment is decomposed into variability among annual recruitment estimates based on information in the data and a residual variability. Because data are never perfectly informative, we show that estimated recruitment variability will always be less than the true variability among recruitments and that the method implemented here can be used to iteratively estimate the true variability among recruitments.},

This function enhances the ability of SS to operate in data-weak situations and enables it to estimate fishery management quantities such as fishing rates that would provide for maximum sustainable yield and to employ these rates in forecasts of potential yield and future stock status. Complex model configurations such as multiple areas and multiple growth morphs are possible, tag-recapture data can be used to aid estimation of movement rates among areas, and most parameters can change over time in response to environmental and ecosystem factors. SS is coded using Auto-Differentiation Model Builder, so inherits its powerful capability to efficiently estimate hundreds of parameters using either maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference. Output processing, principally through a package developed in R, enables rapid model diagnosis. Details of the underlying population dynamics and the statistical framework used within SS are provided. ?? 2012.},

  abstract = {Effective conservation of marine ecosystems requires the assessment and management of cumulative impacts of multiple activities occurring in the ecosystem. Productivity Susceptibility Analysis (PSA) is a widely used tool to assess the potential impacts of fishing activities on marine ecosystems, particularly in data-poor regions. Yet, PSA and other risk-based approaches often do not account for the cumulative effects of multiple fisheries operating in the same region. Here we amend PSA to incorporate multiple fisheries by proposing a new index for cumulative risk assessment, i.e. Aggregated Susceptibility (AS). We applied this extended PSA to 81 species caught in 5 small-scale fisheries along the coast of Baja California, Mexico, and compared the results to the original PSA. Using the original PSA approach, 18 species (22.2\%) were scored as high risk, and twenty-five species (31\%) are at low risk from all of the fisheries conducted in this region. When the cumulative risk posed by all fisheries is assessed using our proposed methodology, the proportion of species at high risk increases to 38.3\%, whereas the proportion of species at low risk decreases to 21\%. For 13 species, the high-risk assessment is made only when scores are aggregated. Among the 5 fisheries, the set gillnet fishery has the greatest impact, which accounted for half of the high risk species and should be the focus of further investigation on how to best manage this fishery. Our analysis demonstrates the importance of accounting for the potential cumulative impacts of multiple co-occurring fisheries for the conservation of coastal marine ecosystems, identifies relative risk imposed by multiple fisheries, and provides a tool for a preliminary evaluation of the possible outcomes of management alternatives. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Assessing the stock status of mixed and/or multi-species fishery resources is challenging. This is especially true in highly diverse systems, where landed catches are small, but comprise many species. In these circumstances, whole-of-ecosystem management requires consideration of the impact of harvesting on a plethora of species. However, this is logistically infeasible and cost prohibitive. To overcome this issue, selected ‘indicator’ species are used to assess the risk to sustainability of all ‘like’ species susceptible to capture within a fishery resource. Indicator species are determined via information on their (1) inherent vulnerability, i.e. biological attributes; (2) risk to sustainability, i.e. stock status; and (3) management importance, i.e. commercial prominence, social and/or cultural amenity value of the resource. These attributes are used to determine an overall score for each species which is used to identify ‘indicator’ species. The risk status (i.e. current risk) of the indicator species then determines the risk-level for the biological sustainability of the entire fishery resource and thus the level of priority for management, monitoring, assessment and compliance. A range of fishery management regimes are amenable to the indicator species approach, including both effort limited fisheries (e.g. individually transferable effort systems) and output controlled fisheries (e.g. species-specific catch quotas). The indicator species approach has been used and refined for fisheries resources in Western Australia over two decades. This process is now widely understood and accepted by stakeholders, as it focuses fishery dependent- and/or independent-monitoring, biological sampling, stock assessment and compliance priorities, thereby optimising the use of available jurisdictional resources.},

  abstract = {Understanding the status of fish stocks is a critical step in ensuring the ecological and economic sustainability of marine ecosystems. However, at least half of global catch and a vast majority of global fisheries lack formal stock assessments, largely due to a lack of sufficient data. Catch data, loosely referring to any catch records be it inclusive of discards or not, are the only type of fishery data available across a wide range of fisheries at a global scale. This has given rise to a long list of so-called “catch-only” models, intended to estimate aspects of stock status based primarily on characteristics of a fishery's catch history. In this paper, we review the history, performance and potential of “catch-only” models to estimate stock biomass status. While individual catch-only models often report good performance, repeated efforts to examine the performance of these models have consistently found them to be imprecise and biased when applied to new data-limited fisheries. We demonstrate that a large reason for this is the simple lack of information on stock status contained in the shape of a catch history alone. Off-the-shelf use of catch-only models can lead to poor and biased estimates of stock status, potentially hindering efforts at effective management.},

  abstract = {Lake Erie supported the greatest yield of lake sturgeon within the Laurentian Great Lakes near the end of the 19th century with {$>$}2000 metric tons caught at the peak of the fishery. The fishery collapsed by the 1920s when {$<$}1\% of the previous peak catch was removed. Despite closures of the fishery, lake sturgeon remain rare in Lake Erie. We applied a depletion-based stock reduction analysis (DB-SRA) to the catch of lake sturgeon from 1879 to 1929 to gain estimates of sustainable fishery reference points and the historic carrying capacity of Lake Erie for lake sturgeon. We also simulated population growth of lake sturgeon from 1929 to the present with varying assumptions of the current carrying capacity of the lake. The estimated historic carrying capacity of lake sturgeon was 22,652 metric tons. During the height of the fishery, exploitation was as high as 37\% which was more than an order of magnitude greater than that required for maximum sustainable yield. Projections of the population from 1929 to 2016 suggest sufficient time has passed since the collapse of the fishery that the population should have recovered to levels that would support a fishery at maximum sustainable yield. However, lake sturgeon remain rare in Lake Erie indicating that other factors such as habitat availability may be limiting their recovery. Our estimates of carrying capacity will be informative when setting recovery targets which consider the amount of habitat loss.},

Meeting these goals requires increased efficiency at all steps in the assessment process from data processing, through model development and selection, to report writing and review. Here, we describe one widely used tool that has proven successful in increasing the efficiency of the assessment process: the r4ss package, which supports the use of the Stock Synthesis modeling framework. What began 15 years ago as a tool to provide simple model diagnostics, including plots showing data and model results, has grown into a large collection of R functions to support many aspects of the assessment process. We provide an overview of the r4ss features and illustrate its utility with examples from recent applications. Finally, we discuss lessons learned from the ongoing development of r4ss that can be applied to similar efforts associated with the next generation of stock assessment packages.},

  abstract = {Appropriate management strategies for coastal regions require an understanding of how ecological similari- ties and differences among species shape ecosystem processes. Here, we tested whether morphological similarity equated to similar age and growth patterns in two common coastal sharks in northern Australia. Vertebrae of 199 pig-eye (Carcharhinus amboinensis) and 94 bull (C. leucas) sharks were sourced principally from commercial fisheries operating along the Northern Territory coastline during 2007–2009. We sectioned vertebrae to provide estimates of age of these animals. Model averaging results indicated female pig-eye sharks matured at 13 years and lived .30 years. Theoretical asymptotic length (LN) (`s.e.) was estimated to be 2672 (`11.94) mm with a growth coefficient (k) of 0.145 year␣1. Male pig-eye sharks matured slightly earlier than females (12 years) and survived .26 years. Theoretical asymptotic length for males (LN) (`s.e.) was also smaller (2540 ` 13.056) mm and they grew faster (k  0.161 year␣1) than females. Bull sharks matured at 9.5 years and reached a maximum theoretical size (LN) (`s.e.) of 3119 mm (`9.803) with a similar growth coefficient (k  0.158 year␣1) to pig-eye sharks. Longevity of bull sharks was estimated to be more than 27 years. Our results indicate that these patterns of high longevity and slow growth are indicative of low resilience and high susceptibility to over-exploitation of these coastal sharks.},

  abstract = {This study presents a new, open-source modelling software entitled ‘Just Another Bayesian Biomass Assessment’ (JABBA). JABBA can be used for biomass dynamic stock assessment applications, and has emerged from the development of a Bayesian State-Space Surplus Production Model framework, already applied in stock assessments of sharks, tuna, and billfishes around the world. JABBA presents a unifying, flexible framework for biomass dynamic modelling, runs quickly, and generates reproducible stock status estimates and diagnostic tools. Specific emphasis has been placed on flexibility for specifying alternative scenarios, achieving high stability and improved convergence rates. Default JABBA features include: 1) an integrated state-space tool for averaging and automatically fitting multiple catch per unit effort (CPUE) time series; 2) data-weighting through estimation of additional observation variance for individual or grouped CPUE; 3) selection of Fox, Schaefer, or Pella-Tomlinson production functions; 4) options to fix or estimate process and observation variance components; 5) model diagnostic tools; 6) future projections for alternative catch regimes; and 7) a suite of inbuilt graphics illustrating model fit diagnostics and stock status results. As a case study, JABBA is applied to the 2017 assessment input data for South Atlantic swordfish (Xiphias gladius). We envision that JABBA will become a widely used, open-source stock assessment tool, readily improved and modified by the global scientific community.},
